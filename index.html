			 <p>Obsidian&rsquo;s Insider Build 1.4.1 has a new feature called &ldquo;Properties,&rdquo; which lets us manage metadata for each file using a user-friendly UI. We can hide YAML Front Matter from our file and view properties in a side panel, making a much cleaner experience.</p>

			 <p>By utilizing these simple formatting tricks, you can easily organize and categorize your highlights in Readwise, making reviewing and retaining important information from your sources easier.</p>
<p>You can do this by simply formatting a note to your highlight. </p>
<p>My favorites include:</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://blog.readwise.io/tag-your-highlights-while-you-read/">Inline tagging</a></strong></p>
<p>Add a tag to your source highlight to tag it when imported into Readwise automatically. </p>
<p>Add a note with a period (.) followed by the name of your tag. </p>
<p><code>.tag1</code></p>
<p><code>.tag2</code></p>
<p><code>.tag3</code></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://blog.readwise.io/combine-highlights-on-the-fly/">Concatenate highlights</a></strong></p>
<p>Combine multiple highlights from the source into one highlight in Readwise. </p>
<p>Add a note with a period (.) followed by the letter “c” and then an incrementing number. </p>
<p><code>.c1</code></p>
<p><code>.c2</code></p>
<p><code>.c3⁠</code></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://blog.readwise.io/add-chapters-to-highlights/">Add headings</a></strong></p>
<p>This is handy, especially for books where you want to separate your highlights by chapter. </p>
<p>Add a note with a period (.) followed by the letter “h” and the heading level you want.</p>
<p><code>⁠.h1</code></p>
<p><code>.h2</code></p>
<p><code>.h3</code></p>
<p>These tricks make Readwise even more powerful and valuable.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The biggest problem with changing tools is that it feels like progress. You suddenly feel like you’re getting something done, but you’re not. You’re merely shuffling deck chairs, but it feels like you’re making progress.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Curtis talks about how switching tools can feel productive. I’ve indeed fallen into this trap (and am still falling).</p>
<p>Focus on the system and not the tools. Track your problems and only switch tools after evaluating and making an informed decision.</p>

This feature allows you to both read and listen to a book at the same time.</p>
<p>I find that when I&rsquo;m only reading with my eyes, my mind tends to wander, regardless of whether I&rsquo;m using a Kindle or physical books. If I only listen to an audiobook, my eyes take over, and I start looking at things and distracting myself. If I close my eyes, I tend to doze off.</p>
<p>Reading the book while listening at the same time has enabled me to stay focused. <strong>I suppose it&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;m keeping both senses occupied.</strong> It’s also keeping me at a set pace, since I’m following along with the audio. When I’m only reading words, I tend to jump around and skip a lot.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780593236604">Outlive</a> by Peter Attia, MD 📚</p>
<p>The book Outlive by Peter Attia, MD is a guide to learning and planning for a long, healthy life. It is very detailed and covers the science behind it, as well as providing actionable advice. <em><strong>This post includes some of my notes from the book and the author&rsquo;s other content.</strong></em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;There comes a point where we need to stop just pulling people out of the river. We need to go upstream and find out why they’re falling in. —Bishop Desmond Tutu</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an example schedule of the recommended training from this book. This is the minimum time you need to spend to get the benefits that will extend your life. Of course, any exercise is better than none!</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h2 id="objectives-strategies-and-tactics">Objectives, Strategies, and Tactics</h2>
<p>Simply seeing your physician every year for an annual physical is not enough. This only evaluates what’s happening with your health <em>now</em>. You need to be proactive if you want to live longer. If you want to play the long-game with your life, you need to start with your objective, then define a strategy, then define tactics.</p>
<p>Your <strong>objectives</strong> would inlude defining what you want to be able to do in your old age. Common examples include picking up and playing with grandchildren, walking your dog, not be in pain, etc.</p>
<p>You then reverse-engineer your objectives and create a <strong>strategy</strong>.  The strategy is the higher level approach to how you will achieve your goals. What will you learn, what ways will you approach the problems.</p>
<p>The <strong>tactics</strong> are the things you do day-to-day and week-to-week that will help you achieve your objective.</p>
<h2 id="insulin-resistance">Insulin Resistance</h2>
<p>Insulin resistance is a major contributor to cancer, Alzheimer&rsquo;s, heart disease, and other medical conditions. It occurs when the body&rsquo;s cells don&rsquo;t respond correctly to insulin, which results in too much glucose entering the muscles and organs.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, exercise is the most effective way to combat insulin resistance, not nutrition.</p>
<h2 id="zone-2-training">Zone 2 Training</h2>
<p>Zone 2 training involves low-intensity exercise that is active enough for you to have a conversation without running out of breath. It is typically 70-85% of your peak heart rate.</p>
<p>During Zone 2, most of the work is done by your &ldquo;slow-twitch&rdquo; muscles that are rich in mitochondria. The mitochondria are “the power plants of the cell” and Zone 2 training can help them use fat as fuel.</p>
<p>To benefit and improve your health, you need at least 3 hours of Zone 2 training per week, split into four 45-minute sessions.</p>
<h2 id="vo2-max-training">VO2 Max Training</h2>
<p>VO2 Max is the highest rate at which a person can use oxygen during strenuous exercise. It is an indicator of aerobic fitness and endurance performance.</p>
<p>Achieving VO2 Max can be done by working at maximum intensity for four minutes, followed by a four-minute rest period. Repeat this cycle four times per week and measure your VO2 Max annually to measure progress. Apple Health and other fitness trackers have built-in VO2 Max measurements, though they may be less accurate than tests you can get at a medical facility.</p>
<p>Having a VO2 Max below average doubles the risk of death, which is even greater than the risk posed by smoking.</p>
<p>If your new to exercising, focus on Zone 2 Training for 6 months before starting VO2 Max Training.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>VO2 Max is perhaps the most powerful marker for longevity. - Peter Attia, MD</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="strength-training">Strength Training</h2>
<p>Strength training increases muscle mass, which uses excess glucose. As we age, we lose muscle, so the more muscle mass we can build while we&rsquo;re younger, the more we&rsquo;ll have stored for our later years.</p>
<p>To maximize the benefits of strength training, perform exercises 3 days per week with a focus on grip strength. Examples of exercises that target concentric, eccentric, and isometric strength include farmer&rsquo;s carry, deadlifts, and more. Eccentric strength is especially important to prevent injuries, such as the ability to stop yourself from falling.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also important to note that strength training is not effective if we don&rsquo;t consume enough protein in our diet. Aim for about 1g of protein per pound of total body weight per day (2.2g/kg/day).</p>
<h2 id="stability-training">Stability Training</h2>
<p>Stability is essential for training, as it helps to prevent injury and is necessary for strength and performance. When we lack stability, we might be strong, but we are wasting energy in the wrong places, such as joints and other muscles, which prevents us from reaching our full potential. <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>To ensure stability, dedicate 10-15 minutes of your day to stability training and one hour twice a week. Focus on Dynamic Neuromuscular Stabilization (DNS), which is based on natural movements.. <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="nutrition">Nutrition</h2>
<p>When it comes to nutrition, there are some key principles to follow. One of them is getting enough protein. Protein is the most important macronutrient and we often don&rsquo;t consume enough of it. As we age, it becomes even more important to aim for 1g/lb/day (2.2g/kg/day) of protein, based on our current body weight. This should be spread out throughout the day, as excess protein can be converted into glucose.</p>
<p>In addition to protein, strive to eat healthy most of the time. Whole foods are preferable to processed food. However, the best approach is to monitor your own nutrition and adjust according to what works for you.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Getting nutrition wrong has far more negative consequences than getting it right. <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="sleep">Sleep</h2>
<p>We need to sleep between 7 1/2 and 8 1/2 hours each night. Sleep deprivation can lead to insulin resistance. High stress can lead to poor sleep, which can further increase stress levels.</p>
<p>Studies show that sleeping less than 6 hours is associated with a 20% higher risk of heart attack. People who sleep less during middle age years are more likely to develop dementia later in life.</p>
<p>A couple of hours before bedtime, turn off unnecessary lights, especially LED, and replace blue lights with warmer colored lights. Get at least half an hour of sunlight during the day, which will also help with sleep. Keep your room and bed cool while sleeping.</p>
<h2 id="breathing">Breathing</h2>
<p>Breathing is essential for balance, motion, and power. It also reflects our emotional state. Long, slow breaths can suggest relaxation, while short, quick breaths can suggest anxiety.</p>
<p>An ideal inhalation engages the entire rib cage and abdomen simultaneously.</p>
<h2 id="mental-health">Mental Health</h2>
<p>Investigate Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), a therapeutic approach designed to help people process trauma. It can also be beneficial for those with less severe emotional health concerns. <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup></p>

<p>And if they are reading books to learn things, they&rsquo;re not doing anything with it. And when I say they&rsquo;re not doing anything with it, they&rsquo;re not actively adding it to a philosophy of practice, understanding it from an awareness of the evidence, the research, the basis of where it comes from.

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I’ve been a longtime user of RSS feeds, and therefore Feed Readers, such as Google Reader back in the day. I’ve gone from Google Reader to Feedly and in the past couple years have bounced around from various services such as Inoreader, Feedbin, and others.</p>
<h2 id="hundreds-of-feeds">Hundreds of feeds</h2>
<p>As a result, I’ve accumulated hundreds of feeds over the years. And keeping up with them has been a hassle. In fact, I felt an urge every day to process all of my feeds, like I do with an email inbox. This resulted in unnecessary anxiety. Sounds stupid, but that’s life.</p>
<h2 id="starting-over">Starting over</h2>
<p>So, a couple of months ago, I thought I would drop all of my feeds and only subscribe back to the few that I actually miss. This helped tremendously. I’m back to a handful of new items every day that I can easily get through in one sitting.</p>
<h2 id="the-rules">The rules</h2>
<p>In an attempt to keep myself from over subscribing, I try to follow a few rules.</p>
<ol>
<li>Follow people, not organizations. This means no feeds from big companies, like Microsoft, Google, Apple, and the big news companies like The Verge. There is simply too much noise.</li>
<li>Add new feeds to a special folder, which I review periodically. If the content is not providing value, I unsubscribe. If I enjoy it, I’ll move it to my main folder. This gives me a chance to follow a few new sources and see how they hold up.</li>
<li>If I can’t get through my feeds in 30 minutes or less, then I need to start purging again.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="the-email-inbox-for-rss">The email inbox for RSS?</h2>
<p>I also tried using email instead of a feed reader. In this case, I subscribed to more newsletters and used Blogtrottr to send RSS feeds to my email every day. It was nice in that I could create a daily digest of some feeds.</p>
<p>I decided I definitely want to keep the content I wish to read separate from my email. Mixing them was a mess.</p>
<p>I stopped doing this.</p>
<h2 id="youtube-subscriptions">YouTube subscriptions</h2>
<p>I also started adding all of my YouTube subscriptions to my RSS feeds. Subscribing to my favorite YouTube channels through RSS is a success. While it adds more feeds, it keeps me off the YouTube home page and lets me consume videos without the algorithm getting involved.</p>
<h2 id="microblog">Micro.blog</h2>
<p>I also tried adding my Micro.blog feeds to my feed reader.</p>
<p>While it’s useful to see my timeline in my RSS reader, it adds a lot of noise. Moreover, I enjoy using the Micro.blog app. I think it is set up in a way that lets me skim the latest and ignore the rest. It also gives me direct access to comments and the option to reply myself.</p>
<p>Therefore, I no longer subscribe to my Micro.blog timeline through my feed reader.</p>
<h2 id="what-im-using">What I’m using</h2>
<p>I’m currently using <a href="https://www.reederapp.com" title="Reeder">Reeder</a> on iOS as my feed reader, and I’m enjoying it.</p>
<p>There are also a few newsletters that don’t provide RSS that I subscribe to. I use <a href="https://kill-the-newsletter.com" title="Kill The Newsetter">Kill the Newsletter</a> to convert these emails into an RSS Feed. It works flawlessly, and it&rsquo;s free.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Look at your past work. Because creative burnout often comes with self-doubt, it’s easy to forget all our past accomplishments and focus on our present challenges instead. Go browse your past work, both the good and the bad. If it’s good, remember how it wasn’t easy to produce. If it’s bad, look at how much progress you have made. Channel the feelings you experience while reviewing your past work to overcome your self-doubt.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve always struggled to commit to using Apple Notes as my main notes app because it is difficult to get notes out. While some apps and tools are available to help with bulk exporting from Apple Notes, it still feels like a lock in. The other reason is, while I think Apple notes is great for capturing, I don&rsquo;t prefer to write in it. It&rsquo;s something about the layout, formatting options that bother me.</p>
<p>However, when I think about the way I use my note&rsquo;s app (at least how I want to use it) is as a scratchpad for capturing information that will be later transformed and shared as something new. When I think of it this way, I feel more comfortable with Apple Notes because I realize it is just a tool that I use to create the real value that is created and shared elsewhere. I could replace Apple Notes without needing to migrate all the content.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Ulysses to do all of my writing recently since, not only is it a great writing tool, but also great for publishing (to Micro.blog and Ghost in my case). I&rsquo;ll be trying Apple Notes for a while as my scratchpad where I throw ideas, sketches, bookmarks, and other things of interest. The fuel I need to create better content.</p>

			 <p>I moved all of my bookmarks from <a href="https://raindrop.io" title="Raindrop">Raindrop</a> to <a href="https://anybox.app" title="Anybox">Anybox</a> today. I’m not certain if it will be a permanent change yet. They are both bookmarking services that allow you to capture web bookmarks, images, files, etc.</p>
<p>The process was simple. Export my Raindrop bookmarks as an HTML file. Import the HTML file into Anybox. It even kept all of my tags.</p>
<p>It seems that Anybox has more options and more native apps on the Mac and iOS, although Raindrop’s new iOS app is pretty sweet. Anybox also has the ability to add standalone notes and files that I may utilize. It also appears to have a lot of automation capabilities that I may look into further.</p>
<p>The biggest downside is that Anybox is not available on Windows. The way I have my current setup, that may not be a big deal. I have my Mac monitor below my Windows monitor and can easily switch back and forth throughout the day using Logitech flow. I tend to store my personal knowledge and links on my Mac and only use Windows for work.</p>
<p>I’ll give it a few weeks and see how it works out.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve been using Things 3 for all my personal and work tasks, and it&rsquo;s been a joy. I wish more apps would copy its simplicity and ease of use.</p>
<p>One of my favorite features is the ability to navigate and search by typing without switching to my mouse, and adding a task is also effortless with just the keyboard.</p>
<p>Another great feature is the ability to filter by tag in any view. I use this on my &ldquo;Anytime&rdquo; view in the mornings to browse all my tasks and decide what to focus on that day. A quick ctr-T sets the &ldquo;When&rdquo; date to today.</p>
<p>I appreciate the ability to set tasks with actual deadlines, and the main “When” date is used to indicate when I plan to work on it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a well-designed app that other apps could learn a lot from.</p>

			 <p>I’ve been using Bear Notes for personal notes for the past week and enjoy it.</p>
<p>I would use Bear for work if it was available on Windows and was local only. I then remembered UpNote.  <a href="https://getupnote.com/">UpNote</a> is a notes app I&rsquo;ve tried in the past that is highly similar to Bear, but it is cross-platform and is updated frequently.</p>
<p>I saw on my Mac that Upnote could work locally only without syncing your data. Perfect, I thought!</p>
<p>I then installed UpNote on my Windows machine and, without logging in, started adding some notes. It worked flawlessly until&hellip;</p>
<p>&hellip; I realized I need UpNote premium to use tables, have unlimited notes, export to PDF, and other critical features. No problem, I thought, because UpNote is dirt cheap, $24.99 for lifetime access. I thought it was worth the price.</p>
<p>Next, I realized I couldn&rsquo;t pay for a premium license without an account (a limitation in the Windows app). Understandable. So, I created an account and set it up on my Mac.</p>
<p>I then switched to Windows, and it said my account was upgraded, and everything was good to go.</p>
<p>Nope!</p>
<p>I signed out of my account because I didn&rsquo;t want to sync my work notes. I want it locally on my machine. As soon as I log out, my premium license is gone. You must be signed in and syncing data to have a premium license.</p>
<p>What a bummer. I tried to give you money UpNote, but such a simple limitation is all it took to keep me on Obsidian at work.</p>
<p>Regardless, I still highly recommend UpNote for anyone looking for something similar to Bear but is cross-platform. Remember that you can&rsquo;t use Premium on Windows without syncing data.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Please, document your work! I&rsquo;m speaking from the context of a software developer/architect, but this also applies elsewhere.</p>
<p>In the moment, it may feel like a waste of time. You may think, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll remember this.&rdquo; or &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never do this again.&rdquo; I&rsquo;ve been there (and still think this). However, documenting has so many advantages. I&rsquo;m pushing myself to do better at it constantly. More documentation with less effort.</p>
<p>Creating documentation is a great way to go through whatever it is in greater detail and ensure you don&rsquo;t miss anything. I can&rsquo;t count how many times I thought I was finished with a task but then found something I missed while writing out what I did.</p>
<p>Writing, in general, helps to ensure you understand a topic. If you can&rsquo;t write about it, perhaps you don&rsquo;t understand it as thoroughly as you thought you did.</p>
<p>Referring to a document to complete a task can dramatically speed up the execution time and improve quality. You spend a little more time upfront to save time in the future.</p>
<p>One of my favorite reasons to document my work is so that I can give it to others to do next time. I can send them the documentation and allow them to complete the task independently. Better still, when your team has access to all your documentation, they&rsquo;ll learn they don&rsquo;t need to come to you in the first place!</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an awesome feeling when someone asks you a question, and rather than taking time to answer it now, you can send them a link to the documentation. It may be an official Word Document, a OneNote page, or even a blog post.  If you don&rsquo;t have the answer documented by someone, add the answer to the documentation now! I don&rsquo;t know how many times I&rsquo;ve answered the same question multiple times when I could have documented it. (I&rsquo;m trying to be better about this.)</p>
<p>My &ldquo;work&rdquo; documentation is either in OneNote or other Office documents. I&rsquo;m doing this because these destinations are shared with my team and easily discovered in the Microsoft 365 universe. My personal documentation resides in markdown files tucked neatly inside my favorite notes app, and some are published as blog posts.</p>
<p>Where do you keep your documentation, and how detailed do you get with it?</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>With some <a href="https://help.micro.blog/t/excluding-a-category-from-the-blog-homepage/1316/5">help</a> from the community, I figured out how to filter the home page of my Micro.blog site to exclude “Micro Posts, “ a category I created for the short posts without a title.</p>
<p>Why? In my case, I want only to show the full articles on my home page. I have a separate page for all my “Micro Posts.” I think this will make my home page more presentable to visitors to the site.</p>
<p><strong>Every theme could differ; mine is based on the default theme.</strong></p>
<p>The trick to filtering the posts by category is to use Hugo’s <a href="https://gohugo.io/functions/symdiff/">symdiff</a> function.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hugo’s <a href="https://gohugo.io/functions/symdiff/">symdiff</a> function returns the symmetric difference between two collections. That’s just a fancy way to say: “give me the things that are in either of these collections but not in both.” - <a href="https://help.micro.blog/u/sod">@sod</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>These lines handle the filtering. Replace “Micro Posts” with the name of the category you want to exclude.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-html" data-lang="html">{{ $posts := where site.Pages &#34;Type&#34; &#34;post&#34; }}
{{ $hidden_posts := where $posts &#34;Params.categories&#34; &#34;intersect&#34; (slice &#34;Micro Posts&#34;) }}
{{ $posts = $posts | symdiff $hidden_posts }}
</code></pre></div><p>Next, if we want to continue to use Pagination on the home page, we’ll need to call the Paginate function and pass in the $posts variable created above it.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-html" data-lang="html">{{ $paginator := .Paginate $posts }}

<blockquote>
<p>The concept of Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) is flawed in that it fails to recognize that there is more to knowledge management than simply collecting, storing, and organizing data. Rather, knowledge management is a process of transforming data into information and then into knowledge through the application of cognitive processes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While PKM tools can be helpful in collecting, organizing, and connecting the information you gather, it is up to you to do something with that information to turn it into knowledge.</p>

			 <p>I’m constantly changing the apps I use. I like to experiment with what works. But I also like to play with new toys. I tend to experiment and chat about new apps I’m trying, but in reality, I have a few core apps that I tend to stick to.</p>
<p>I like to take inventory now and then as it helps me clean up my system and see how things change over time. This isn’t an exhaustive list, but it highlights the main apps and utilities I use daily.</p>

<h2 id="experiments">Experiments</h2>
<p>I tried using <a href="https://blot.im" title="Blot">Blot</a> for my website. I was writing in Obsidian and posting to Blot, where it would immediately appear on my blog. It was awesome, but I’ll stick with ￼Micro.blog￼ for simplicity.</p>
<p>I tried <a href="https://obsidian.md" title="Obsidian">Obsidian</a> for all of my writing. I still prefer Ulysses, and I think it’s more about the organization of notes and distractions that become available in Obsidian that sways me back to Ulysses.</p>
<p>I tried <a href="https://logseq.com" title="Logseq">Logseq</a> for work notes, and it works great for getting things down and creating tasks throughout the day. My biggest grip is that I usually must share notes with my team. Taking light notes in OneNote and immediately updating the documentation for our project works best in the long run. Tasks immediately go into Azure DevOps and are assigned to team members or Microsoft To-Do (accessed through Outlook) for personal work tasks.</p>
<p>I experimented with a <a href="https://getrocketbook.com" title="Rocketbook">Rocketbook</a> notebook. It didn’t stick. Not a problem with the notebook itself. When I get busy, I struggle to do anything analog, although that seems like it should be the best time to use analog. :( The Rocketbook reminded me of writing on my iPad with the Apple Pencil, which reminded me that I could do that by just taping my iPad Lock Screen and starting to write. I still jot down thoughts this way.</p>
<p>I also experimented with dropping my RSS feeds altogether. That didn’t go well because I spent more time jumping to various sites to keep up with things. I returned to RSS, tried <a href="https://www.inoreader.com" title="Inoreader">Inoreader</a> for a minute, and thought about returning to <a href="https://feedbin.com" title="Feedbin">Feedbin</a>, but ultimately just added my RSS feeds and newsletters to the Readwise Reader app. Now everything is in one place. Readwise Reader is growing on me, and it is complex but has some great features.</p>
<p>I played with some AI tools, like <a href="https://chat.openai.com/chat" title="ChatGPT">ChatGPT</a> and <a href="https://www.bing.com/new" title="Microsoft Bing Chat.">Microsoft Bing Chat</a>. I see them as useful search tools for research and troubleshooting.</p>
<p>I foresee myself testing <a href="https://loop.microsoft.com/learn" title="Microsoft Loop">Microsoft Loop</a>, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2023/03/16/introducing-microsoft-365-copilot-a-whole-new-way-to-work/" title="Microsoft Copilot">Microsoft Copilot</a>, and other miscellaneous tools next.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>At the end of every weekday, I go through and color-code my calendar from the day that just finished. 
Green = Energy Creating Yellow = Neutral Red = Energy Draining. I don’t spend too much time thinking about which bucket each item fell into—I try to trust my gut.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I like this idea of color coding the calendar to show what gives you energy vs. what drains your energy. It could be a great way to work on balancing things out. I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;ll do it, but I&rsquo;ll keep it in mind.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve been quiet the past couple of weeks. I&rsquo;m working on a few things, including some website updates. I moved my Micro.blog site to <a href="https://blog.ericgregorich.com">blog.ericgregorich.com</a> and moved my <a href="https://ericgregorich.com">main site</a> to <a href="https://blot.im">Blot.im</a>.</p>
<p>The only reason for this move is because Blot fits my workflow better. I can take all my markdown notes in Obsidian and easily publish them to my website using Git. I have local markdown files for everything, which is my goal.</p>

			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781039000070">How to Calm Your Mind</a> by Chris Bailey 📚</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This book discusses different ideas for managing stress, cultivating a mindset for productivity, and several techniques to help improve overall well-being.</p>
<h2 id="my-summary">My Summary</h2>
<p>The book, How to Calm Your Mind by Chris Bailey is about determining what causes stress in your life and taking action to reduce it. The opposite of Anxiety is Calm, so the more calm we have in our lives, the more tolerance we have for stress.</p>
<p>The book has a nice balance of storytelling, research, and actionable advice. Chris doesn&rsquo;t get technical or ramble on pointless stories, either. It was an easy-to-read book with a few actionable takeaways.</p>
<p>This was my favorite of the books I&rsquo;ve read related to this topic.</p>
<h2 id="key-ideas">Key Ideas</h2>
<h3 id="accomplishment-mindset-p16">Accomplishment mindset (p16)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>A conditioned set of attitudes and beliefs that drive us to strive constantly to accomplish more.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="definition-of-calm-p23">Definition of calm (p23)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>A subjectively positive state characterized by a low level of arousal, with an accompanying absence of anxiety.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="types-of-stress-p30">Types of stress (p30)</h3>
<ol>
<li>Acute stress - Temporary and often one-off. Things that come up cause stress at the moment but fade away.</li>
<li>Chronic stress - Ongoing stress that does not fade away over time.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="productivity-hours-p35">Productivity Hours (p35)</h3>
<p>Schedule a period during which you are productive during the day. During the remaining time, chill. You can still do things, but don&rsquo;t worry about being productive. This time should be scheduled daily to account for the variations in our days.</p>
<h3 id="stress-inventory-p41">Stress Inventory (p41)</h3>
<p>Write down the things that cause you to stress, whether chronic or acute. This helps you identify the causes of stress in your life so you can start to address the source.</p>
<h3 id="burnout-equation-p49">Burnout Equation (p49)</h3>
<p>To feel burnout, we need to feel exhausted but also cynical and unproductive. We usually only think of exhaustion as part of burnout.</p>
<h3 id="burnout-threshold-p56">Burnout Threshold (p56)</h3>
<p>How much chronic stress can we take before we burn out?</p>
<h3 id="burnout-factors-p59">Burnout Factors (p59)</h3>
<ol>
<li>Workload</li>
<li>Control</li>
<li>Insufficient Reward</li>
<li>Community</li>
<li>Fairness</li>
<li>Values</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="the-mindset-of-more-p68">The mindset of more (p68)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>A set of attitudes that drive us to strive for more at all costs, regardless of context.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="dopamine-anticipation-p76">Dopamine Anticipation (p76)</h3>
<p>Dopamine is often referred to as a &ldquo;pleasure&rdquo; chemical, but it is not. Instead, it is a chemical associated with the anticipation of something pleasurable.</p>
<h3 id="related-neurochemicals-p83">Related Neurochemicals (p83)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Serotonin makes us feel happy.</li>
<li>Oxytocin makes us feel connected.</li>
<li>Endorphins give us a sense of euphoria.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="engagement-is-the-opposite-of-burnout-p84">Engagement is the opposite of burnout (p84)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The polar opposite of burnout is engagement - Christina Maslach</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>When we&rsquo;re burnt out, we&rsquo;re exhausted, unproductive, and cynical. When we&rsquo;re engaged, we feel energized, productive, and driven by purpose.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="make-a-list-of-things-you-savor-p91">Make a list of things you savor (p91)</h3>
<p>Make a list of the things you savor, and try to do as much as you can daily.</p>
<h3 id="superstimuli-p109">Superstimuli (p109)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>A highly processed, exaggerated version of things we&rsquo;re naturally wired to enjoy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Examples include social media, pornography, YouTube, Netflix binge-watch, etc.</p>
<h3 id="dopamine-fast-p138">Dopamine Fast (p138)</h3>
<p>Cut out as many dopamine-producing activities as possible for one month. This should reset your dopamine baseline to normal levels. Then you can introduce some things with limitations.</p>
<h3 id="hedonic-adaption-p144">Hedonic Adaption (p144)</h3>
<p>Having less of something makes us savor it more. When we overdo something, like social media, our baseline changes, and then we crave even more to get the same feelings. A Dopamine Fast (p138)|Dopamine Fast helps reset the baseline.</p>
<h3 id="the-advantages-of-digital-p158">The advantages of digital (p158)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The digital world is valuable only as far as it supports us in what we intend to accomplish.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="analog-gives-us-time-to-think-p163">Analog gives us time to think (p163)</h3>
<p>When our mind is allowed time to wander, it makes connections. This is why we often think more clearly when we write on paper because as we slow down, our mind is thinking ahead. When we write quickly digitally, our mind only has time to make the same connections. If you take your time digitally, you could get the same impact.</p>
<h3 id="meditation-p176">Meditation (p176)</h3>
<p>Meditation gives us time to notice things. We often lose focus when trying to meditate, which is normal, but by refocusing, we&rsquo;re training our minds to slow down.</p>
<h3 id="slow-breathing-p178">Slow Breathing (p178)</h3>
<p>Slow breathing stimulates the vagus nerve, which connects the body to the brain.</p>
<p>A good slow-breathing technique is the 4-7-8 technique.</p>
<ul>
<li>Inhale for a count of 4.</li>
<li>Hold for a count of 7.</li>
<li>Exhale for a count of 8.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="caffeine-p187">Caffeine (p187)</h3>
<p>Caffeine has been shown to increase cortisol and epinephrine (adrenaline) production. Try a caffeine reset, and if you enjoy coffee, try introducing it back into your diet as a treat rather than a necessity.</p>
<h3 id="l-theanine-p185">L-theanine (p185)</h3>
<p>L-theanine is an amino acid found in green tea and matcha that reduces how much adrenaline your body produces in response to caffeine. It&rsquo;s a great way to get caffeine without the spikes and jitters.</p>
<h3 id="eating-and-stress-p188">Eating and stress (p188)</h3>
<p>Stress causes us to want to eat more and less healthfully. Our body craves and retains fat in response to stressful situations. This is how we&rsquo;re wired from our primitive days. But today, we don&rsquo;t use this additional energy like we used to, and it causes us to hold onto the fat we generate.</p>
<h3 id="attentional-space-p201">Attentional Space (p201)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Attentional Space is our working memory capacity &hellip; the more mental space we have to work with, the deeper we can think, the more we can process at one time, and the better we perform.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="measuring-productivity-p211">Measuring Productivity (p211)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The trick to measuring productivity is to reflect on how much you accomplish.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It isn’t easy to measure productivity in any other way. Gauging by the time spent or widgets produced is not a good reflection of whether we&rsquo;re productive. We must reflect on our day and decide for ourselves if we are productive. Productivity is about doing what we intend to do.</p>
<h2 id="action-items">Action Items</h2>
<ul>
<li>Define productivity hours</li>
<li>Make a stress inventory.</li>
<li>Make a list of things I savor.</li>
<li>Execute a month-long dopamine fast.</li>
<li>Incorporate movement daily.</li>
<li>Meditate daily.</li>
<li>Cut out or cut back on caffeine.</li>
</ul>

			 <p>Cal Newport explains how he marks up physical non-fiction books for his research.  He simply adds a slash to the corner of the page containing anything of interest, adds a block to the side of the text and sometimes adds a star for important things. No notes. No highlights.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I had a newsletter a year or so ago where every week, I would gather all of my bookmarks, notes, and resources and turn them into a newsletter where I would share these valuable links with some brief commentary.</p>
<p>I gave up the newsletter because I often had weekends when I was out of town and was very busy during the week. Taking a couple of hours out to formulate the newsletter was too time-consuming for me.</p>
<p>Now that I have switched over the Micro.blog, I realize I&rsquo;m doing the same thing but with a different, more efficient process.</p>
<p>Rather than pulling it all together once per week, I write content as I discover it throughout the week and post it immediately to my blog. This makes writing much easier because I&rsquo;m doing it immediately and can write about whatever is on my mind.</p>
<p>My Micro.blog <!-- raw HTML omitted -->newsletter<!-- raw HTML omitted --> then automatically sends every Sunday and contains all of the posts from the previous week.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m essentially writing the same thing, but it&rsquo;s much easier to post a short update as it comes up rather than waiting and trying to refresh what I was thinking. My new newsletter/blog also feels less formal, with less pressure to write something outstanding every week.</p>
<p>My last point (for now) is that posting immediately to my blog has eliminated the need for taking notes in many cases. Or perhaps, my blog posts are my notes. 🤔 I no longer need to organize notes for myself if it&rsquo;s already posted to my site.</p>
<p>If you like my informal, sometimes blabbering content, where I share resources, interesting content, and random thoughts, you can subscribe to my <!-- raw HTML omitted -->newsletter<!-- raw HTML omitted --> here. It is delivered every Sunday to your email inbox.</p>

			 <p>A productivity technique created by Tony Stubblebine, Interstitial Journaling combines note-taking with time tracking.</p>
<p>To implement Interstitial Journaling, you write down the current time and what you’re doing or thinking at that time. Try to write in this log after completing tasks, meetings, etc.</p>
<p>This technique has become very popular with modern apps like Roam Research, LogSeq, and Tana, where you have a Daily Page where you dump everything into. The advantage of doing this in a digital tool is that you can easily link to other notes in your system (if your app supports it).</p>
<p>The Bullet Journal is a popular analog note-taking, essentially Interstitial Journaling. Bullet Journal doesn’t recommend using the current time before each of your notes. Otherwise, it’s the same system—you write brief tasks and notes throughout the day.</p>
<p>9:15 AM - Code review for XYZ app.</p>
<p>10:27 AM - Starting the estimate for ABC Corp.</p>
<p>11:32 AM - Wrapped up the estimate for ABC Corp. I think parts of this can be reused. These are always easier to do than I anticipated. I should create an archive for estimates somehow.</p>
<p>Noon - Lunch</p>
<p>12:27 PM - Writing about Interstitial journaling.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I stumbled across this <a href="http://richardcarter.com/sidelines/charles-darwins-note-making-system">article</a> by Richard Carter that describes how Charles Darin took notes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you were to keep a portfolio open for a couple of years, and throw in slips of paper as subjects crossed your mind, you would soon have a skeleton (and that seems to me the difficulty) on which to put the flesh and colours in your inimitable manner.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Darwin would mark up books, write literature notes, and even create a rough abstract of the books he read. He originally would use bound notebooks but later found them too restrictive, favoring the loose slips of paper instead.</p>
<p>The main takeaway is that he did not create a perfect system from the beginning, It always changed. The key is to capture notes and revisit them to create something useful.</p>

<p>Using a simple index card is a simple technique to help you focus during the day.</p>
<p>The process is simple.</p>
<ul>
<li>Each day, pull out a new card.</li>
<li>Write down the most important tasks you want to complete that day.</li>
<li>During the day, focus on those tasks.</li>
<li>Add other tasks as they come up. You don’t need to do these today but you still want to jot them down.</li>
<li>Add brief notes on the backside.</li>
</ul>
<p>This technique would be used with whatever task management solution you currently use. Rather than jumping in and out of your task app all day, you can write down the most important tasks and jot down other to-dos and notes on your card throughout the day. Reconcile what’s on your index card with your other apps at the end of each day.</p>
<p>Writing down your daily tasks helps you plan and enables you to prioritize.</p>
<p>I enjoy the index card for this rather than a paper notebook because it is much simpler and has limited space, and I can have it standing next to my monitor to see it all day.</p>
<h2 id="option-1-just-an-index-card">Option 1: Just an index card</h2>
<p>The simplest and cheapest option is to buy a pack of standard 3x5 index cards. They work fine; you can pull a card out daily and leave it on your desk as you work.</p>
<h2 id="option-2-a-nice-index-card-and-cardholder">Option 2: A nice index card and cardholder</h2>
<p>If you want a nice upgrade to the system, you can purchase some <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09BDHM427?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;linkCode=sl1&amp;tag=focustivity04-20&amp;linkId=0bc9087f0889b001a0df5cba73bd4b99&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" title="vertical To-Do Index cards">vertical To-Do index cards</a>. The cards I’m using are higher quality than a standard index card, and the front has a place for your tasks and the back for other notes and doodles. You can find other cards on Amazon or an office supply store to your liking.</p>
<p>Next, find a nice ￼<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07T628TZ7/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1" title="business card holder">business card holder</a>￼ to keep your cards upright, making a big difference. Your task list is now next to your monitor and is hard to miss.</p>
<h2 id="option-3-analog-by-ugmonk">Option 3: Analog, by Ugmonk</h2>
<p>If you want to go all out, <a href="https://ugmonk.com/pages/analog" title="Analog">Analog</a> by Ugmonk has a high-quality card system that you can purchase. The starter kit is $65, and the cards require a subscription for $10 per month. The Analog kit includes a walnut or maple card box with a magnetic lid to secure your other cards, and it also comes with Task cards for Today, Next, and Someday.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I have recently discovered that I love writing on paper. It allows me to escape the digital world, and writing on paper allows me to think without distractions.</p>
<p>But paper can be messy. You deal with flipping through pages, smudging, mistakes that are difficult to fix, inability to move things, etc. While some argue this adds to the experience, there could be a better solution for some.</p>
<p>The reMarkable 2 is an e-ink device, similar to a Kindle, but built for writing. The reMarkable tries to feel like paper and provide a distraction-free writing environment while getting digital advantages.</p>
<p>You may love using the reMarkable 2 if:</p>
<ul>
<li>You enjoy writing on paper.</li>
<li>You want a distraction-free place to write.</li>
<li>You want to keep your notes backed up automatically.</li>
<li>You want to share your notes easily.</li>
<li>You don’t want to keep buying paper planners or notebooks.</li>
<li>You like the idea of unlimited pages.</li>
<li>You want to be able to search for notes quickly.</li>
<li>You want to be able to fix mistakes, move things around, and easily make updates.</li>
<li>You also want to read and annotate.</li>
</ul>
<p>This article is my in-depth device review, including the hardware and software. It includes what I like and what I don’t like. I hope it will help you if you decide to purchase a reMarkable 2 for yourself.</p>
<h2 id="first-impressions-of-the-hardware">First Impressions of the Hardware</h2>
<p><img src="https://ericgregorich.com/uploads/2023/bd94f9fd72.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The hardware is stunning. It is thin and light, and the all-aluminum body gives it a nice solid feel. It is like holding a slate; a solid strip on the left gives it a nice look.</p>
<p>The material is the same on both sides. The back has four rubber nubs to keep the device from sliding around on a solid surface. The right side of the device has a magnet so you can attach the Marker.</p>
<p>The battery life seems excellent. I have not had the device long enough to say exactly how long it will last. So far, I’ve had the tablet for six days and only charged it once, and it was at about 70% charge when I received it. reMarkable says “weeks of battery,” but that depends on how much you use the device. I probably have it turned on for several hours per day.</p>
<p>It’s hard to complain about anything on the hardware itself. If anything, the screen margins are pretty thick, especially at the bottom. It’s hard to notice until you are writing and start to run out of space on the page.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tip: You’ll need an external light source to see the screen. Don’t expect to read in the dark!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The other thing to note is that this device has no backlight. No backlight means you need an external light source to be able to see the screen.</p>
<h3 id="technical-specifications">Technical Specifications</h3>
<p><img src="https://ericgregorich.com/uploads/2023/ee786b3659.png" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="remarkable-marker">reMarkable Marker</h3>
<p><img src="https://ericgregorich.com/uploads/2023/181cdbb1b2.png" alt=""></p>
<p>You can get either the regular Marker or the Marker plus. The Marker is white and has no buttons or eraser, and I have not used one, so people say it feels nice and has a nice texture based on my research.</p>
<p>The Marker Plus is what I have, and the primary differences are that 1) It’s black, and 2) it comes with an eraser. The texture is excellent, and it has a nice weight to it. One side is flat, which serves two purposes, 1) to keep it from rolling off your desk, and 2. to attach to the device magnetically. I have had no problems writing with it. I also don’t feel it will easily detach from the device unless you toss it in a bag.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is the extra $50 for the Marker Plus if it includes an eraser? I feel like it is. If you are like me and always messing up, it is simple to flip the Marker over and quickly erase it. It saves a lot of time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Neither of the Markers needs to be charged.</p>
<p>The biggest downside of the Marker is the tips. The tips are replaceable because they wear down. I have not had mine long enough to know how long they last. Based on my research, it could be every week to every six weeks. The reMarkable comes with nine extra tips and a way to replace them. The Marker Tips currently cost $14 for a replacement pack.</p>
<p><img src="https://ericgregorich.com/uploads/2023/37a92b375a.png" alt=""></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tip (pun intended): Don’t forget about the tips. It can be easy to miss them in the packaging. You’ll want to set them aside where you can find them again.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="the-book-folio">The Book Folio</h3>
<p><img src="https://ericgregorich.com/uploads/2023/806a6748f9.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I opted for the Gray Book Folio (Polymer Weave). It is very thin and covers the device nicely. Removing the reMarkable from the cover is effortless, yet it stays in place firmly.</p>
<p>The material is acceptable — nothing to get excited over. It doesn’t feel like it is worth $99. But it’s cheaper than the $149 leather Book Folio (which I hear doesn’t feel like natural leather). It’s probably worth getting just because it helps protect your investment.</p>
<h2 id="first-impressions-of-the-software">First Impressions of the Software</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>I was running version 2.5.0.27 when I wrote this since there have been drastic software improvements!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I had no problems figuring out how to use the software. It is very straightforward. Your main screen consists of your folders and files. Across the top are options to open the menu, create a folder, create a notebook, access Quick Sheets, or search. You can see the battery life, Wi-Fi connection, and sync status across the bottom of the main screen.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tip: Talking about distraction-free, it doesn’t even have a clock!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I won’t go into details about the software interface; I think it works well and is pretty smooth. It would be best to remember that this is an e-ink device, and the page refresh differs from a typical tablet. I feel like the refresh is faster than my Kindle Paperwhite, and I have not had any issues with the performance.</p>
<p>Sometimes the swipe event does not register, and I have to swipe multiple times to get it to swap between pages or close a notebook. It is not an issue if you swipe in the right place and with enough motion.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tip: You can close any notebook or PDF you are on by swiping down from the top of the screen. Much faster than trying to use the menu.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="layers">Layers</h3>
<p>You can create Layers on your page, allowing you to manipulate one layer without affecting the other. Make elaborate sketches and diagrams or add text over a custom background.</p>
<h3 id="text">Text</h3>
<p>Another cool feature is the ability to convert your handwriting to text. This feature works as well as can be expected. Your writing must be clear enough for it to recognize the words. You can only convert one or more pages to text. Once the conversion is complete, you have no choice but to email it somewhere. You can’t save the converted text to the device.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tip: You need to connect to Wi-Fi for text conversion.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="templates">Templates</h3>
<p>The device comes with many built-in templates that you can use. The built-in templates include everything from dots to standard notebook lines with margins.</p>
<p><img src="https://ericgregorich.com/uploads/2023/6372bedaba.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I immediately found myself not finding the templates that I wanted to use. Fortunately, you can add your custom templates with a bit of know-how. For more information, you can look at some of the additional resources I have at the bottom of this article.</p>
<p>Fortunately, you can also use a PDF for your Daily Planner notebook type. You can find them everywhere, and Etsy is an excellent place to start. I added some more resources to the bottom of this article.</p>
<h3 id="sharing">Sharing</h3>
<p>You can share pages or entire notebooks or PDFs from the device. You’ll be prompted to enter an email address or select an email you already used. You can add a message, change the filename, and select an export format (PDF, PNG, or SVG). The feature works well enough.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tip: You can always download the PDF on your desktop and do what you want with it from there.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="search">Search</h3>
<p>From the search icon, you can easily search for any notebook, PDF, or Epub on your device. You will also see the most recently updated files on your device, making it easy to switch back and forth.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, your notes and files’ content is not searched — only the file names and folders.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="cloud-sync">Cloud Sync</h3>
<p>While using the reMarkable Cloud Sync is not required, it is hard to avoid. The advantage of using Cloud Sync is that your content is automatically backed up to the cloud and available on your other devices.</p>
<p>The Cloud Sync works okay and is not instantaneous (most of the time), but it gets the job done.</p>
<h3 id="the-read-on-remarkable-browser-extension">The “Read on reMarkable” Browser Extension</h3>
<p>There is a new Browser extension from the Remarkable team called &lt;a href=&ldquo;<a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/read-on-remarkable/bfhkfdnddlhfippjbflipboognpdpoeh%22">https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/read-on-remarkable/bfhkfdnddlhfippjbflipboognpdpoeh&quot;</a>&gt;Read on reMarkable&lt;/a&gt;.“ This extension lets you send nearly any webpage to your device with a single click. You have two options. The default is to send the page to the device in Epub format. This method looks excellent but does not include the source or any images! So I switched my default to PDF. The page is converted to PDF with this setting and sent directly to your device. The PDF option includes images and more information about the article.</p>
<p>How the content looks on the device is hit or miss. It depends on the source content. If the page is full of ads and poorly formatted, it will be low quality on the device. I’ve found that sites with a clean format look great on the device.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tip: Use the PDF format to include images and the source for your articles.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="desktop-and-mobile">Desktop and Mobile</h3>
<p>Speaking of Cloud Sync, you can access your content from your desktop or mobile devices. The desktop and mobile software is nothing spectacular; it merely shows you your content, just as you would see on your device. You can then read, rearrange, or export your content as needed.</p>
<h3 id="jagged-line-issue">Jagged Line Issue</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Tip: This could be a deal-breaker for some. I don’t feel like it is an issue, as I don’t notice it unless I’m looking for it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="https://ericgregorich.com/uploads/2023/1f4c513904.png" alt=""></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Updated March 27, 2021: The reMarkable team released version 2.6, which addresses this issue.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The ”Jagged Line Issue“ is one of the annoying things I found about Remarkable 2. If you look very closely at the writing (zoom in if it helps), you can see the lines are not smooth and jagged, depending on how you write. You can see a very (extremely detailed) video that explains the issue here.</p>
<h2 id="the-writing-experience">The Writing Experience</h2>
<p>Okay, you want to know how this table feels when writing.</p>
<p>It feels remarkable, like writing on paper!</p>
<p>One of the things I enjoy when writing on paper is how distraction-free it is, and the ”feeling&rdquo; of writing helps me slow down and think. I get the same feeling while writing on the Remarkable. In addition to that, I can easily erase, move things around, convert to text, and search.</p>
<p>My writing is better when using the reMarkable. I write very small on paper, while on the reMarkable, I have more space and write larger and, therefore, more legibly.</p>
<p>The latency is about 21ms, which is the best in the market. There is very little noticeable lag when writing.</p>
<h2 id="the-reading-experience">The Reading Experience</h2>
<p>I have limited experience with the reading functionality on the device. But here is what I have discovered so far.</p>
<h3 id="pdf">PDF</h3>
<p><img src="https://ericgregorich.com/uploads/2023/30046a1879.png" alt=""></p>
<p>In general, PDFs look great on the reMarkable 2. My only complaint is that the device is too small to read most PDFs comfortably. Articles converted to PDF work well.</p>
<h3 id="epub">EPUB</h3>
<p><img src="https://ericgregorich.com/uploads/2023/dfa930ab6a.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I have heard that the reMarkable doesn’t work well with EPUB, and I don’t have enough experience with them yet to know for sure. I added one EPUB to the device, &lt;a href=&ldquo;<a href="https://gumroad.com/l/doing-content-right%22">https://gumroad.com/l/doing-content-right&quot;</a>&gt;Doing Content Right, by Steph Smith&lt;/a&gt;. It looks great! I’ve had no problems, and it has been much easier to read than the PDF version.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tip: You cannot read your Kindle books on this device.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="the-price">The Price</h2>
<ul>
<li>The reMarkable itself is $399.</li>
<li>The Marker is $49. The Marker Plus is $99.</li>
<li>The Folios start at $69 and go up to $149.</li>
</ul>
<p>My setup, the reMarkable with the Marker Plus and Book Folio, came to $597 before tax. Ouch!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tip: Yes, you see that correctly. The reMarkable writing device does not include a Marker, which is ridiculous!</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="what-would-make-the-remarkable-2-better">What would make the reMarkable 2 better?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fix the Jagged lines issue. (reMarkable fixed the Jagged Lines issue in version 2.6)</li>
<li>Include the content, even your handwritten notes, in search results.</li>
<li>Faster sync.</li>
<li>More Text Conversion options.</li>
<li>Provide better formatting for both PDF and EPUB.</li>
<li>Better support. I have not needed to contact the reMarkable support team, but I have not heard great things regarding response times.</li>
<li>Provide more support for accessing your content without using Cloud Sync.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is worth purchasing a reMarkable 2 if you like to write and if you like to use paper for organizing your day. Taking meeting notes, writing thoughts, drafting articles, making sketches and diagrams, disconnecting from the world, and getting lost in your thoughts is excellent.</p>
<p>While I love the reMarkable 2 and use it daily as part of my workflow, it is not a perfect device. The good news is that, in theory, software updates could resolve some of the existing problems.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for a distraction-free digital writing device, I highly recommend it.</p>
