			 <p>A great directory of <a href="https://defaults.rknight.me">App Defaults</a> created by Robb Knight. Inspired by the Hemispheric Views <a href="https://defaults.rknight.me">Episode 097 - Duel of the Defaults!</a>, which I truly enjoyed listening to. A list of blog posts that talk about their own App Defaults. Each blog has an RSS feed! Download the full OPML file at the bottom!</p>

			 <p>Spent time this morning adding my favorite RSS feeds into Feedbin. A clean slate. I also have Micro.blog timeline and Discover, newsletters, and favorite YouTube channels.</p>
<p>I probably cut back the total number of feeds by 60%, at least.</p>
<p>I like Feedbin‚Äôs simplicity and ability to send to Kindle.</p>

			 <p>I had a long afternoon troubleshooting a production issue. I fixed the primary issue immediately but couldn‚Äôt tell because my tests failed. Hours later I realize my instance of the app on Windows was passing the date in an incorrect format.</p>

			 <p>I was frustrated with Window management on my Windows PC. FancyZones was not flexible, and the out-of-box is not good on wide screens.</p>
<p>I found <a href="https://mizage.com/divvy/">Divvy</a>, which lets me use keyboard shortcuts or select from a grid for exact positioning.</p>
<p>I decided to use it on my Mac, also. It‚Äôs nice having consistency!</p>

			 <p>I signed up for a <a href="https://kagi.com">Kagi</a> trial yesterday. Kagi is a paid search engine that has an ad-free experience. I have it all set up on my machines and iPhone, and now I need to see how well it works.</p>
<p>Google is such a mess these days. You have to scroll to get past the ads and see actual results!</p>
