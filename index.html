			<h1><a href="https://ericgregorich.com/2022/11/24/upnote-a-beautiful.html">UpNote - A beautiful, cross-platform app for notes</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://ericgregorich.com/2022/11/24/upnote-a-beautiful.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2022-11-24 10:05:15 -0500">Nov 24, 2022</time></a>

			 <p>When it comes to my note-taking app, I have a few criteria.</p>
<ul>
<li>Can I write in it? I‚Äôm talking about simple, distraction-free writing. Markdown support is necessary to write and add some basic formatting without leaving the keyboard.</li>
<li>Can I get my notes out of it? I don‚Äôt want to use any application where I‚Äôll struggle to move my notes elsewhere.</li>
<li>Is it available everywhere? As a user of Windows, Mac, and iOS, I need an app that will work everywhere.</li>
<li>Is it flexible? Can I organize my notes by folders or tags? I don‚Äôt organize much and rely on search to find what I need. Some simple tags and a couple of folders suit my workflow.</li>
<li>Can I easily publish my notes elsewhere? Sometimes it‚Äôs my blog. Sometimes it is to a PDF or some other application.</li>
</ul>
<p>If I were only using a Mac, I‚Äôd probably use Bear for my notes. I love its clean and simple interface, speed, and export capabilities. But I‚Äôm also using Windows, so I‚Äôve been searching for an app that will meet my requirements.</p>
<p>I have been using Evernote for years, and it checks some of the boxes. The biggest downside to Evernote is the note editor is not as clean as I would like, and getting notes out of Evernote can be a pain Although many apps import from Evernote, it‚Äôs not a great experience.</p>
<p>Then I discovered <a href="https://getupnote.com" title="UpNote">UpNote</a>, a notes app similar to Bear. UpNote supports markdown and has a focus mode, making it a pleasure to write in. The sync is fast and reliable. It has plenty of features. I can organize by folder and tags. And it‚Äôs available on macOS, Windows, iOS, Android, and even Linux. I can export to various formats, including Markdown or PDF.</p>
<p>What is UpNote missing? Well, on paper, it‚Äôs not missing much. In reality, a few things would make it perfect (for me). One is the ability to drag and drop notes into folders. Not a big deal. Since folders can be organized in any order, you can create sub-folders and even add colors and images to folder thumbnails, I‚Äôll let it slide. Maybe some more explore options and better Markdown export. When I copy Markdown into other apps, sometimes I have to fix some things.</p>
<p>There is also something else that is missing that I can‚Äôt quite put my finger on. You may get some level of polish from apps like Bear or Ulysses. UpNote is a beautiful app, but if I were to compare the UI, Bear might be a 9 or 10, while UpNote is an 8 or 9. UpNote‚Äôs UI is beautiful but safe and not as exciting to use as other premium apps.</p>
<p>I will stick with UpNote for a while and see if it meets my needs long-term. Let me know if you use the app yourself or know of any similar apps!</p>

		<a href="https://ericgregorich.com/2022/11/17/bending-spoon-purchased.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2022-11-17 08:38:54 -0500">Nov 17, 2022</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Evernote <a href="https://evernote.com/blog/evernote-next-move-joining-bending-spoons/" title="announced">announced</a> they had been acquired by <a href="https://bendingspoons.com" title="Bending Spoons">Bending Spoons</a>, a developer of mobile apps. Bending Spoons is known for (or not known for) its mobile apps, including, Splice, Remini, and 30 Day Fitness.</p>
<p>Like many, my first thoughts were, ‚Äúthis doesn‚Äôt make sense. Evernote is doomed!‚Äù. However, Bending Spoons must have the funds and technology to take Evernote to the next level. In a way, this is kind of exciting. Let‚Äôs hope they don‚Äôt blow it.</p>
<p>What does this purchase mean for Evernote? It‚Äôs hard to say without knowing more about Bending Spoons. Looking through their website, it appears they‚Äôre heavily invested in AI (who isn‚Äôt these days). Adding some AI to Evernote could be pretty exciting. Evernote is already great (if not the best) at capturing and storing information. Adding AI to help connect notes, write text, update media, etc., could be a welcome addition. It‚Äôs also possible Bending Spoons does absolutely nothing with Evernote, and it‚Äôs business as usual.</p>
<p>I‚Äôve been an Evernote user for over a decade and have accumulated nearly 7 thousand notes. Like many, Evernote has become a dumping ground where everything gets added to a massive black hole, never to be seen again. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, Evernote search is excellent, and with OCR, notebooks, and tags, users who like to use Evernote for their daily workflow have many options.</p>
<p>I keep jumping into the Evernote app to see what‚Äôs new and occasionally to grab an old note. I just haven‚Äôt been able to stick with it lately because of the bloat. There are many other simple and sleeker tools out there today.</p>
<p>I must admit that Evernote has come a long way in the past year or two after its massive rewrite. The app is pretty fast and responsive on all platforms. If it had better export and the ability to hide the features I don‚Äôt want to use, it would be tempting to use it full-time again. At this point, I‚Äôll wait to see how this acquisition turns out before jumping back in.</p>

			 <p>A productivity technique created by Tony Stubblebine, Interstitial Journaling combines note-taking with time tracking. <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>To implement Interstitial Journaling, you simply write down the current time and what you‚Äôre doing or thinking at that time. Try to write in this log after completing tasks, meetings, etc.</p>
<p>This technique has become very popular with modern apps like Roam Research, LogSeq, and Tana, where you have a Daily Page where you dump everything into. The advantage of doing this in a digital tool is that you can easily link to other notes in your system (if your app supports it).</p>
<p>The Bullet Journal is a popular analog note-taking, essentially Interstitial Journaling. The difference is Bullet Journal doesn‚Äôt recommend using the current time before each of your notes. Otherwise, it‚Äôs the same system‚Äîyou write brief tasks and notes throughout the day.</p>
<p>An example:</p>
<ul>
<li>9:15 AM - Code review for XYZ app.</li>
<li>10:27 AM - Starting the estimate for ABC Corp.</li>
<li>11:32 AM - Wrapped up the estimate for ABC Corp. I think parts of this can be reused. These are always easier to do than I anticipated. I should create an archive for estimates somehow.</li>
<li>12:00 PM - Lunch</li>
<li>12:27 PM - Writing about Interstitial journaling.</li>

			<h1><a href="https://ericgregorich.com/2022/11/06/things-i-love.html">4 things I love about Feedbin</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://ericgregorich.com/2022/11/06/things-i-love.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2022-11-06 10:51:10 -0500">Nov 6, 2022</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I use a feed reader to pull in all the articles I‚Äôm interested in (using RSS), YouTube channels I subscribe to, social network lists, and even email newsletters. This allows me to avoid endless feeds, algorithms, and unwanted ads. When I read something, it is marked as read, and I don‚Äôt need to see it again.</p>
<p>I‚Äôve tried several feed readers over the years since Google Reader was killed. The list includes Feedly, Inoreader, NetNewsWire, News Explorer, Reader, and others. Some of them have great features that I like. I especially liked the ability to take highlights and notes in Feedly pro, and they would sync automatically into my Readwise account.</p>
<p>However, the feed reader I‚Äôve stuck with the longest is <a href="http://feedbin.com" title="Feedbin">Feedbin</a>. Why? I think there are a few reasons.</p>
<h2 id="1-feedbin-is-simple">1) Feedbin is Simple</h2>
<p>Feedbin doesn‚Äôt try to do too much. It has a simple and clean UI. You can use other Feed Readers with Feedbin, like <a href="https://reederapp.com" title="Reeder">Reeder</a>, <a href="https://www.goldenhillsoftware.com/unread/" title="Unread">Unread</a>, and many <a href="https://feedbin.com/apps">others</a>. I find the Feedbin iOS apps are great and get the job done.</p>
<h2 id="2-feedbin-supports-newsletters">2) Feedbin supports newsletters</h2>
<p>As I said, I now send all of my newsletters directly to Feedbin. This helps keep my email clean. I like the way Feedbin handles email newsletters. Rather than parsing the text, like it would most web articles, it gives me the option to show the newsletter in its original format, which I find better.</p>
<p>Here is an example newsletter from <a href="https://nesslabs.com" title="NessLabs">Ness Labs</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://ericgregorich.com/uploads/2022/9d094e3c73.png" alt="Example Ness Labs newsletter shown in Feedbin"></p>
<h2 id="3-feedbin-handles-tweets-and-microblog-posts-well">3) Feedbin handles Tweets and Micro.blog posts well</h2>
<p>Feedbin lets you subscribe to Twitter users and lists, which is excellent in itself, but I love that I can click the little chat icon and see the entire thread directly in Feedbin.</p>
<p><img src="https://ericgregorich.com/uploads/2022/c48a1967bc.png" alt="Example Tweet Thread in Feedbin"></p>
<p>This also works with Micro.blog. If you add the <a href="https://micro.blog/discover" title="Discover Feed">Discover feed</a> or follow individual users, you click on the small Micro.blog icon to see the entire thread without leaving Feedbin.</p>
<p>You still need to leave Feedbin and open the original post to reply. :(</p>
<h2 id="4-feedbin-lets-me-share-directly-to-microblog-and-others">4) Feedbin lets me share directly to Micro.blog and others</h2>

			 <p>I finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780593138526" title="Stolen Focus">Stolen Focus</a> by Johann Hari üìö</p>
<p>Stolen Focus does not provide a personal step-by-step guide to remove distractions from our lives. Instead, it is about how this ‚ÄúAttention Crisis‚Äù impacts society.</p>
<p>Here are some of my notes about the author‚Äôs points in this book.</p>
<h2 id="what-impact-is-this-attention-crisis-having-on-our-lives">What impact is this Attention Crisis having on our lives?</h2>
<ul>
<li>We‚Äôre finding it harder to find ‚ÄúFlow,‚Äù during which we become engrossed in an activity without disruptions.</li>
<li>With all the tiny bits of information continuously flowing into our lives, it becomes less likely that we‚Äôll read books.</li>
<li>It‚Äôs harder to think because we don‚Äôt allow our minds to wonder as much as we should. Mind wandering is a critical stage in which our brain has insights, makes connections, and plans for the future.</li>
<li>Technology is becoming better at keeping us distracted. The more we look at their service, the more money the company makes, so they manipulate us to keep us engaged.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-is-contributing-to-this-attention-crisis">What is contributing to this Attention Crisis?</h2>
<ul>
<li>We‚Äôre bombarded with chemicals that harm our health and, ultimately, our attention.</li>
<li>Failing to explore ADHD. More people than ever are diagnosed with ADHD, yet we‚Äôve prescribed medications rather than solving the causes.</li>
<li>Our children are not allowed to explore and play like in the past. They‚Äôre no longer playing in the streets and wandering the neighborhood. They‚Äôre told precisely what to do in school and what the outcome should be rather than allowing creative learning.</li>
<li>We‚Äôre not getting enough sleep due to artificial light and consumer capitalism. We‚Äôre spending too much time flipping through Tick-Tock videos rather than going to bed at a decent time and allowing our brains to recover and make connections during sleep.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-do-we-recover">How do we recover?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fewer work hours to allow us more time to rest and recover.</li>
<li>Allow our children more time to play and explore, especially at school.</li>
<li>Change our technology to be less disruptive to our lives. Yet, the companies building it do not have an incentive to do so unless regulations are established, which is an entirely different issue.</li>
<li>Take it upon ourselves to control what we consume, get more sleep and exercise, and spend quality time reading and just being bored. It‚Äôs good for us!</li>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I stumbled across this <a href="http://richardcarter.com/sidelines/charles-darwins-note-making-system">article</a> by Richard Carter that describes how Charles Darin took notes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you were to keep a portfolio open for a couple of years, and throw in slips of paper as subjects crossed your mind, you would soon have a skeleton (and that seems to me the difficulty) on which to put the flesh and colours in your inimitable manner.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Darwin would mark up books, write literature notes, and even create a rough abstract of the books he read. He originally would use bound notebooks but later found them too restrictive, favoring the loose slips of paper instead.</p>
<p>The main takeaway is that he did not create a perfect system from the beginning, It always changed. The key is to capture notes and revisit them to create something useful.</p>

			 <p>Writing what‚Äôs on my mind is something I struggle with. I think the issue is not the writing itself; it‚Äôs the distractions and mind wandering. I have difficulty focusing for a long enough period to produce something worth reading.</p>
<p>Even when I get on track and start writing something, I lose focus and never finish what I started, or more often, I wrap it up early and hit publish. ‚ÄúGood enough.‚Äù. Maybe that‚Äôs why I enjoy Micro.blog so much since it quickly makes it easy to post something without giving it much thought.</p>
<p>I also get distracted by tools and apps. Changing my system will always fix the problem, right?</p>
<p>I enjoy writing and think it helps me clear my mind. It is one of the few things I do that forces me to focus. So, I don‚Äôt want to stop.</p>
<p>To help improve my writing, I will try a few obvious things.</p>
<ol>
<li>Block distractions as much as possible.</li>
<li>Dedicate the same time every day to writing.</li>
<li>Continue to post short thoughts (like this) on my blog.</li>
<li>I‚Äôm tempted to create a new blog (maybe on Substack?) where I post long-form essays. The kind that requires a lot of time and research. This would be more of an exercise to create a routine and dedicate time to something I enjoy.</li>

			 <p>Reading <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780593138526" title="Stolen Focus">Stolen Focus</a> by Johann Hari üìö, the author discusses the ‚ÄúDisruption of Mind Wandering‚Äù in Chapter 5 and how we tend to consider mind wandering negative. Yet, the author explains, it‚Äôs part of how we learn and create.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúCreativity is not where you create some new thing that‚Äôs emerged from your brain.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a new association between two things that were already there.‚Äù Mind-wandering allows ‚Äúmore extended trains of thought to unfold, which allows for more associations to be made.‚Äù - Stolen Focus p96</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While this is nothing new, it caught my attention because I am a daydreamer. Ever since I was a kid, I would get in trouble for not paying attention. I suppose my excuse now is, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm creating something!‚Äù.</p>
<p>Mind wandering is a necessary part of how our brains work. For example, as we read, we focus on the words. Our mind tries to make connections to the ideas we‚Äôre reading about. We may think of past experiences, related reading, or even contradictions. This is precisely what we should be doing. This part of reading helps us learn and make sense of things.</p>
<p>Of course, we can easily take our minds wandering too far when we‚Äôre trying to read but keep thinking about checking Twitter or what‚Äôs for dinner. In these cases, we‚Äôre getting into distraction territory.</p>

<p>As a kid, I‚Äôve always struggled with focus and attention, even without digital distractions. I‚Äôm a daydreamer. Today‚Äôs digital tools have made our lives simpler, yet at a cost. Even as I read the introduction to this book, I noticed I picked up my phone at least twice.</p>
<p>Staying focused becomes more manageable when working on something I enjoy‚Äîwriting code, building something, solving a problem. It‚Äôs easy to get into focus during those times. We can‚Äôt always be in deep focus. What do we do when we‚Äôre not?</p>
<p>I‚Äôm hoping this book is not only about scare tactics. I‚Äôm not expecting some miracle cure, but perhaps a guide through my own thoughts to help figure out what works for me.</p>
<p>I hope I can stay focused enough to read through the nearly 300 pages in this book. :)</p>

			 <p>I discovered a new podcast app for iOS called <a href="https://feedbin.com/airshow" title="Airshow">Airshow</a>. It is from the same creators of Feedbin, the popular RSS service. What‚Äôs interesting is that Airshow actually uses Feedbin to sync podcasts between devices. This makes sense since it‚Äôs all RSS.</p>
<p>What I like about Airshow is its simplicity. It‚Äôs a beautiful app. There are no bells and whistles. You can add podcasts as a Subscription or Bookmark. Subscriptions are automatically downloaded and added to your queue. Bookmarks give you quick access to podcasts you are interested in but don‚Äôt listen to regularly.</p>
<p>Your queue is a simple list of podcast episodes. You can reorder them and edit them as you like. The queue is synced to your Feedbin account so you can also view the podcasts from Feedbin.</p>

			 <p>I‚Äôve been experimenting with task management and note applications for a while now. I wouldn‚Äôt say I like organizing into folders or even using tags. I‚Äôve gone down that road and spent too much time trying to stay organized.</p>
<p>I want to capture notes from an idea or meeting and keep them front and center until anything actionable from that note is complete. This gives me all the context I need for that task or project. For example, if I‚Äôm working on a development issue, I create a note where I write down anything I need during the troubleshooting process and, in the end, what solved the problem. The note for that issue will stay on my list of active notes until it is complete.</p>
<p>I also want to create the occasional reminder or block-off time on my calendar. Also, associating meeting notes with calendar events is a bonus.</p>
<p>After experimenting with dozens, if not hundreds, of apps, I came across <a href="https://agenda.com">Agenda</a>. I‚Äôve only been using it for a couple of days. So far, it fits my workflow.</p>
<p>I will use Agenda this week for all my notes and tasks and see if I have any problems.</p>

It was a great reminder that we tend to overcomplicate things when building technical solutions. Sometimes, we do it for the challenge, and as developers, it‚Äôs fun. Often we miss the point. What‚Äôs the end goal?</p>
<p>For example, I was just working with a customer who wanted us to update our existing application to allow batching records together based on complicated logic. We spent hours thinking of a solution. Then someone asked, why do they need this? Oh, so one admin can run a report that shows all the records in a batch. Can‚Äôt we add a checkbox to allow the admin to select which records they want to include in the report? Yes! Well, that makes things much easier!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Cognitive scripts are based on the semantic memory, or the knowledge we acquire throughout our lives. Semantic memory develops when we experience events in the everyday world, such as how to travel by public transport or the steps involved in eating in a restaurant. We organise our experiences into cognitive scripts that are personal to us, and these scripts may vary depending on our perception of a situation and the cultures we identify with. - Dr. Hannah England</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We can overwrite our cognitive scripts by journaling, reset the scripts that don‚Äôt work for us, and go off script and take risks.</p>
<p>Cognitive scripts are based on our beliefs, created during our lifetime. Habits are more about the actions we take.</p>

<li>Stop being persuaded by impulses. Your mind and body and simple and don&rsquo;t need extravagance.</li>
<li>Nature will always change to do what is best for nature. You are part of nature. Trust the change.</li>
<li>You have limited time in this world. Don&rsquo;t spend it procrastinating on things of importance.</li>
<li>Focus on things as if it was the last thing you will do in life.</li>
<li>You have one life, and it&rsquo;s almost over.</li>
<li>Take the time to learn things for yourself and less for others.</li>
<li>Listen to your heart, and find your happiness.</li>
<li>No one can prevent you from being in harmony with nature.</li>
<li>Sinning out of desire is worse than doing so out of anger. Passion comes from within, and anger is caused by something external.</li>
<li>Death happens to both good and bad people; therefore, how could it be a bad thing? How could death be a punishment for people who are good all their lives?</li>
<li>Objects are temporary and meaningless.</li>

			 <p>While over the past decade, ‚ÄúProductivity‚Äù books try to teach you how to be productive and get things done, ‚ÄúI Didn‚Äôt Do The Thing Today‚Äù jumps on the recent ‚ÄúAnti-productivity‚Äù bandwagon and reminds us that to be genuinely productive, we need to relax, rest, and embrace the unexpected.</p>
<p><a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780593419144" title="I Didn‚Äôt Do The Thing Today by Madeleine Dore">I Didn‚Äôt Do The Thing Today by Madeleine Dore</a></p>
<p><strong>Key Ideas</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We can‚Äôt compare how productive we are to others because we all have unique circumstances and objectives.</li>
<li>The unexpected and unplanned are often the best part of our days, yet we consider it a ‚Äúbad day‚Äù when things don‚Äôt go as planned. Our routines and schedules should guide us but not induce guilt when they are broken.</li>
<li>Preparation, Incubation, Illumination, and Verification are the 4 stages of creativity.</li>
<li>If we determine the things we ‚Äúcould‚Äù do and be more flexible with when we do them, perhaps the most important things to use will surface and become part of our day without being forced.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Action Items</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Create a plan for the day to act as a guide.</li>
<li>Keep a list of things I ‚Äúcan‚Äù do based on my current time and energy.</li>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780593135204">Project Hail Mary: A Novel</a> by Andy Weir üìö.</p>
<p>Project Hail Mary is a story by the same author of The Martian, Andy Weir. While The Martian&rsquo;s story is grounded in the science we understand today, Project Hail Mary goes beyond that and adds more sci-fi but does so without breaking the rules of science.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>The other difference between The Martian and Project Hail Mary is the scope. In The Martian, Mark Watney is stranded on Mars and needs to figure out how to get home. In Project Hail Mary, the Sun is being destroyed by a phenomenon, and Ryland Grace must travel to a distant star to figure out how to save Earth.</p>
<p>The protagonist, Ryland Grace, is a science teacher who ends up as the sole survivor of the Hail Mary as it travels to its destination, where we hope to figure out how to save Earth. Ryland wakes from a coma with no memory of how he got there or even who he is. Fortunately, his memory comes back over time.</p>
<p>As Ryland is solving one problem after another aboard the Hail Mary, his memories slowly return.  We see the planning of the Project Hail Mary mission on Earth and how Ryland was &ldquo;chosen&rdquo; for the mission. We also see the sacrifices that are made to make the mission happen.</p>
<p>The writing is engaging and fun. While there is a lot of math involved, you can get the point without understanding it. It all makes sense. This is one of the special things about Andy Weir&rsquo;s writing style. You can tell he loves this stuff. He spent a lot of time researching and discussing &ldquo;what if&rdquo; scenarios with real scientists and astronauts. After the success of The Martian, he likely has a pool of resources available to him.</p>
<p>This story is not your typical sci-fi. I felt like this could actually happen. Ryland&rsquo;s problems were science-based and felt realistic, opposed to forced plot twists just to make the story exciting. There were many times in this book where I imagined all of the things that could have been done if this were an action sci-fi story that we would typically see. Instead, we get a great story about a guy working out extraordinary problems.</p>
<p>I really enjoyed this book.</p>

<p>By the way, a Project Hail Mary movie is being made, starring Ryan Gosling.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The novelty bias is a form of informal logical fallacy, where we consider that something is better simply because it‚Äôs new. Of course, in some cases, novelty seeking does correlate with benefits. For example, a newer computer may offer improved speed and performance. However, not all new ideas and objects will offer benefits over something older or more established.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It‚Äôs always easy to see the latest tech innovations (like iPhones) and convince ourselves that we need them. If we think about the pros and cons and let them sit in our minds for a while. We‚Äôll either forget about it or convince ourselves we don‚Äôt need it. In rare cases, the new toy improves our life.</p>

			 <p>If you are using Microsoft Power Automate with Microsoft SharePoint Online list or library data and need to check if a field is empty or null, you can use the¬†<code>@empty</code>¬†function in an expression.</p>
<h2 id="example">Example</h2>
<p>The following example involves setting up a new Power Automate workflow triggered when a user starts the workflow from the SharePoint list. The workflow will check if the &ldquo;President&rdquo; column is empty and update the &ldquo;Is Empty&rdquo; column with the result. ¬†</p>
<h3 id="create-a-sharepoint-list">Create a SharePoint List</h3>
<p><img src="https://ericgregorich.com/uploads/2022/c13cf3ecde.png" alt="Example SharePoint List"></p>
<ul>
<li>Create a new SharePoint list. This demo uses the default Title column, a choice column called¬†<strong>President</strong>, and a Boolean column called &ldquo;Is Empty.&rdquo;¬†</li>
<li>Add some sample data. Leave the President column blank for some items.</li>

<p><img src="https://ericgregorich.com/uploads/2022/51d849bbfc.png" alt="Example Power Automate Flow"></p>
<ul>
<li>Create a new Power Automate Automated Cloud Flow. Select¬†<strong>For a selected item</strong>¬†as the trigger action. Select your SharePoint site and list it in this action.</li>
<li>Add the¬†<strong>Get Item</strong>¬†action and configure it to retrieve the selected item from the list. This step is necessary to retrieve all the columns so we can use them in the workflow. Set the ID to the ID of the For a Selected Item trigger.</li>
<li>Add the¬†<strong>Initialize Variable</strong>¬†action. We want to use the¬†<strong>empty()</strong>¬†function with our President column in the Value. The full expression is¬†<strong>empty(outputs(&lsquo;Get_item&rsquo;)?<a href="#">&lsquo;body/President/Value&rsquo;</a>)</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://ericgregorich.com/uploads/2022/5f3ff9332a.png" alt="Power Automate IsEmpty() Expression"></p>
<ul>
<li>Add an Update Item action that is pointed to your list and set the Is Empty column.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://ericgregorich.com/uploads/2022/0845a91d1e.png" alt="Power Automate SharePoint Item Action"></p>
<ul>
<li>Save the workflow.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="test-your-workflow">Test your workflow</h3>
<ul>
<li>Now, go back to your list and select an item with an empty President value. Under the Automate menu, you should see your workflow listed (it may take a few seconds to load). Please select it and run the workflow.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://ericgregorich.com/uploads/2022/a19e81a9a4.png" alt="SharePoint List Example"></p>
<ul>
<li>Refresh your list after a few seconds; the¬†<strong>Is Empty</strong>¬†column should be¬†<strong>checked</strong>.¬†</li>
<li>Try running the workflow on a row that has a President selected. The¬†<strong>Is Empty</strong>should¬†<strong>not be checked</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://ericgregorich.com/uploads/2022/a80281a441.png" alt="SharePoint List Example"></p>
<ul>
<li>Open the workflow that you ran. You can see that the variable we created resulted in¬†<strong>True</strong>¬†when the column was empty and¬†<strong>False</strong>¬†when it was not.</li>
