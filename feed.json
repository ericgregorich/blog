				"title": "Exploring Microsoft Edge: A Week-Long Experiment",
				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>This week, I put myself through another experiment and used the Microsoft Edge browser exclusively for work and personal.</p>\n<p>I‚Äôve used Microsoft Edge for work for various reasons and never really had any issues with it. For personal, I was using Safari, but I‚Äôve also experimented with Brave, Firefox, and even Arc.</p>\n<p>With all the recent announcements around the <a href=\"https://www.bing.com/new\">new Bing</a> and other features coming to Microsoft Edge, I thought I would try to use the browser for work and personal for at least a week.</p>\n<p>I‚Äôve been pleasantly surprised! No performance issues or crashes. That is to be expected since I‚Äôm already using it for work all day long.</p>\n<p>But there are some features that I started to use that have been surprisingly helpful.</p>\n<h2>Verticle Tabs</h2>\n<p>I don‚Äôt leave tabs open, so I don‚Äôt have much issue managing them, but the verticle tabs give the browser a clean look that I like.</p>\n<h2>Profiles</h2>\n<p>I‚Äôve been using profiles for work since the feature was released. Profiles allow you to quickly switch to a separate instance of Edge with its logins, sessions, cookies, bookmarks, etc. This is ideal for separating work from personal, but I also have about 15 profiles for various clients, and I can log into their Office 365 environment with a click.</p>\n<h2>The Side Bar</h2>\n<p>When the Side Bar feature was first released, I immediately disabled it and never looked back. However, this week I gave it a try. It is pretty handy for searches and even loading specific sites, and I‚Äôve used it with Feedbin, Micro.blog, and Mastodon. It‚Äôs a little glitchy when navigating, but it is convenient for quickly checking email or social updates.</p>\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"Microsoft Edge Screenshot.png\" src=\"https://ericgregorich.micro.blog/uploads/2023/b0f95d942e.png\" alt=\"Microsoft Edge Screenshot\" width=\"772\" height=\"600\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<h2>Shopping</h2>\n<p>Another feature I had immediately disabled prior but thought I would give a go over the past week is the Shopping integration. Annoying or helpful? If you want to save some money, it can be beneficial. You can even track orders and price changes. Will I continue using it? ü§î To be decided...</p>\n<h2>Cross-Device</h2>\n<p>Yes, I‚Äôve also been using Microsoft Edge on my phone and tablet, and it‚Äôs okay. I prefer Safari for its simplicity, but the Edge mobile apps work great, and having everything synced across devices is excellent.</p>\n<h2>AI Integration</h2>\n<p>It‚Äôs too soon to say whether AI integration is helpful, and the features are not released yet. There were <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOeRWRJ16yY&t=1s\">announcements</a> about Bing AI being baked into Microsoft Edge, so you can use it as you browse. Another helpful yet scary feature.</p>\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"Bing AI in Microsoft Edge.png\" src=\"https://ericgregorich.micro.blog/uploads/2023/701a858230.png\" alt=\"Bing AI in Microsoft Edge\" width=\"779\" height=\"452\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<h2>What I don‚Äôt like about Microsoft Edge</h2>\n<p>Of course, there are many things I still don‚Äôt like about Microsoft Edge. Microsoft tries to add every feature under the sun to the browser, causing it to be bloated. I know how to turn most things off, so it‚Äôs manageable.</p>\n<p>Privacy and Security is also a concern. While edge has many features that make your browsing more secure, you have to accept that Microsoft has at least some telemetry data from you. Who knows for sure what they‚Äôre tracking? If that is a concern, look elsewhere.</p>\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"Microsoft Edge Privacy Settings.png\" src=\"https://ericgregorich.micro.blog/uploads/2023/530102d724.png\" alt=\"Microsoft Edge Privacy Settings\" width=\"429\" height=\"600\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<h2>Will I continue using Microsoft Edge?</h2>\n<p>Yes, until I get bored with it and want to try something else. I‚Äôm still trying to grasp all the features available and how they compare to other browsers.</p>\n",

This makes writing much easier because I&rsquo;m doing it immediately and can write about whatever is on my mind.</p>\n<p>My Micro.blog <!-- raw HTML omitted -->newsletter<!-- raw HTML omitted --> then automatically sends every Sunday and contains all of the posts from the previous week.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m essentially writing the same thing, but it&rsquo;s much easier to post a short update as it comes up rather than waiting and trying to refresh what I was thinking. My new newsletter/blog also feels less formal, with less pressure to write something outstanding every week.</p>\n<p>My last point (for now) is that posting immediately to my blog has eliminated the need for taking notes in many cases.

				"content_text": "I had a newsletter a year or so ago where every week, I would gather all of my bookmarks, notes, and resources and turn them into a newsletter where I would share these valuable links with some brief commentary. \n\nI gave up the newsletter because I often had weekends when I was out of town and was very busy during the week. Taking a couple of hours out to formulate the newsletter was too time-consuming for me.\n\nNow that I have switched over the Micro.blog, I realize I'm doing the same thing but with a different, more efficient process. \n\nRather than pulling it all together once per week, I write content as I discover it throughout the week and post it immediately to my blog. This makes writing much easier because I'm doing it immediately and can write about whatever is on my mind.\n\nMy Micro.blog <a href=\"https://ericgregorich.com/subscribe/\">newsletter</a> then automatically sends every Sunday and contains all of the posts from the previous week. \n\nI'm essentially writing the same thing, but it's much easier to post a short update as it comes up rather than waiting and trying to refresh what I was thinking. My new newsletter/blog also feels less formal, with less pressure to write something outstanding every week. \n\nMy last point (for now) is that posting immediately to my blog has eliminated the need for taking notes in many cases. Or perhaps, my blog posts are my notes. ü§î I no longer need to organize notes for myself if it's already posted to my site. \n\nIf you like my informal, sometimes blabbering content, where I share resources, interesting content, and random thoughts, you can subscribe to my <a href=\"https://ericgregorich.com/subscribe\">newsletter</a> here.

Imagine typing about a topic, and the AI presents the notes to you as you type, as it applies to the current context.</p>\n<p>Many note and reading apps already incorporate AI, including Readwise, Mem, Mymind, Craft, and Notion.

				"content_text": "<p>Have you ever started an email to someone that explains a problem to them, one that you don‚Äôt know the solution to, then by the time you finish the email, you‚Äôve realized you have come up with a solution?</p>\n<p>Simply writing out a problem where the explanation is as simple as possible (so someone else can understand it), we are clarifying in our mind precisely what the problem is. You likely don‚Äôt understand if you can‚Äôt explain the situation to someone else.</p>\n<p>Understanding the problem is only the first part. Now we try to come up with a solution. Often there are multiple solutions. So, we start listing some potential solutions and thinking through the pros and cons of each solution.</p>\n<p>As we write out the potential options to solve the problem, we often eliminate specific options based on what we know about the situation. Perhaps it is a budget issue or an infrastructure limitation. The more we can get down on paper (digital or analog) more likely we are to come up with the best options.</p>\n<p>As a Software Architect, this happens to me all the time. So much that I‚Äôve incorporated this into my workflow. When I need to deal with a problem, even if I think I understand the problem, I write it out in the most straightforward explanation possible. Then each option will have pros and cons, and I‚Äôll usually have a recommendation of which option I think would work best or is most reasonable within the current circumstances.</p>\n<p>After going through this process, I‚Äôve often solved the problem and realized the best solution we can implement immediately. Clients love being told there was a problem and that you already took care of it. There is also the added benefit of having everything documented.</p>\n<p>I‚Äôll write on paper when I‚Äôm struggling with something I can‚Äôt wrap my head around. This slows me down, so I can spend time thinking as I go. When writing on a computer, it‚Äôs easy to spit out words that don‚Äôt have as much meaning. On the flip side, a computer makes it easier to delete and reorganize ideas.</p>\n<p>Writing out our problems is not only for technical issues; it can work for anything.

Scheper, üìö a book about how to create an analog Zettelkasten (slip box) that acts as a ‚Äúcommunication partner‚Äù for thinking and creating.</p>\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.micro.blog/photos/300x/https://ericgregorich.micro.blog/uploads/2022/282d352fe5.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"\" height=\"\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>After seeing a couple of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnvMBVMXMPKA4Lmy5Ihd-FQ\">videos</a> from Scott and keeping up with his <a href=\"https://scottscheper.com/\">website</a>, I expected this book to be a deep and dull venture into the analog Zettelkasten, including tons of history and facts. Not that his other content is this way, but the build-up to the book made me think this. However, I thought it flowed nicely and was pretty easy to read. Perhaps this is because I‚Äôm already familiar with the material, so I didn‚Äôt get stuck at any point. Also, the book appears much longer than it is. Each chapter has several pages of footnotes, and I recommend exploring them, but they take up a lot of space.</p>\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"Antinet Zettelkasten-4.png\" src=\"https://ericgregorich.micro.blog/uploads/2022/8c2e145a24.png\" alt=\"Antinet Zettelkasten 4\" width=\"779\" height=\"438\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>Scott explores the analog Zettelkasten, made famous by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niklas_Luhmann\">Niklas Luhmann</a>, a German sociologist, philosopher of social scient, and a prominent thinker in systems theory. Luhmann used a note card system that enabled him to publish dozens of books and hundreds of scholarly articles over his lifetime. The Antinet is Scott‚Äôs version of this system, nearly identical to the original.</p>\n<p>The four principles of the Antinet are Analog, Numeric-Alpha, Tree, and Index. The Net in Antinet stands for network. I won‚Äôt try to go into the details in this post; there are plenty of other <a href=\"https://zettelkasten.de/posts/introduction-antinet-zettelkasten/\">articles</a> that do this well (or get the <a href=\"https://micro.blog/books/ISBN139798986862613\">book</a>).</p>\n<p>While Scott has an <a href=\"https://scottscheper.com/letter/1/\">article</a> on his website explaining how to get started with an Antinet, the book goes into much more detail. You‚Äôll learn how to create the cards, bib notes, index, and other system components. It does take a while to get to the step-by-step instructions, but it‚Äôs probably important to understand the concepts first.</p>\n<p>Scott spends a reasonable amount of time discussing how this analog system can become your ‚Äúcommunication partner.‚Äù This idea is pulled from Luhmann‚Äôs essay ‚Äú<a href=\"http://luhmann.surge.sh/communicating-with-slip-boxes\">Communicating with Slip Boxes</a>.‚Äù If you want to go deeper into Luhmann‚Äôs work, you can visit the <a href=\"https://niklas-luhmann-archiv.de/\">Niklas Luhmann Archive</a>.</p>\n<p>Scott mentions (several times) <a href=\"https://www.soenkeahrens.de/en/takesmartnotes\">How to Take Smart Notes</a> by S√∂nke Ahrens and how, although S√∂nke introduced the Zettelkasten system to modern day, he also gets much of it wrong, especially by trying to make it work in digital tools.</p>\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"Antinet Zettelkasten-2.png\" src=\"https://ericgregorich.micro.blog/uploads/2022/f15c61122a.png\" alt=\"Antinet Zettelkasten 2\" width=\"779\" height=\"438\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Who should create an Antinet?</strong> This system is not for those who need to capture technical notes, meeting notes, etc. This is a thinking tool, and you would use it to gather your thoughts during research. The system is best suited for specific projects where you need to do a lot of research, gather your thoughts, and then create an output (academic paper, article, book, etc.).</p>\n<p>You want to use an analog Zettelkasten because it forces you to slow down and think. Not only do you have to take the time to write notes by hand on index cards, but you also have to think about where to put the card. This is intentional, forcing you to think and connect ideas by flipping through your cards. As you do this, you engrain these thoughts into memory.</p>\n<p><strong>Am I going to create my Antinet?</strong> Maybe someday, but I don‚Äôt need it now. As I mentioned earlier, it is best to have a big project or do a lot of research. I‚Äôll be honest. When I first read How to Take Smart Notes by S√∂nke Ahrens, I tried to create a digital Zettelkasten. I spent about a year of my life trying different tools and approaches. I later realized I was pursuing the system for the wrong reasons. I was trying to force a square peg into a round hole. Not only that, I was trying to replicate it in Digital tools, which misses the point.</p>\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"Antinet Zettelkasten.png\" src=\"https://ericgregorich.micro.blog/uploads/2022/ca15ff2154.png\" alt=\"Antinet Zettelkasten\" width=\"779\" height=\"438\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>Overall, this was a good book. I would recommend you check out Scott‚Äôs <a href=\"https://scottscheper.com\">website</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnvMBVMXMPKA4Lmy5Ihd-FQ\">videos</a> first. If these are interesting, then the book is for you. I enjoyed it more than I expected, but I admit, I geek out on this stuff.</p>\n",

It was <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cjgbest/status/1602370307884318720\">quickly corrected</a> by Substack Co-founder/CEO Chris Best.</p>\n<p>Substack is not ‚Äúpowered‚Äù by Ghost. Instead, a specific site using Substack was built using Substacks theming API, which is compatible with themes built for Ghost. This means the developer who implemented the Substack theme basically ported the Ghost theme for Substack. All of this was done legally using best practices (according to Chris Best).</p>\n<p>What I find funny is all of the responses to the original post, even those posted after the corrections were stated in the same thread. People are congratulating Ghost and have completely made the assumption that <a href=\"https://substack.com\">Substack</a> is now Powered by <a href=\"https://ghost.org/\">Ghost</a>, which is not true at all.</p>\n<p>If you see such a claim by an individual on Twitter, of all places, do you not question its legitimacy?

				"content_text": "<p>This interesting essay explores the ‚ÄúGhost in the Box‚Äù metaphor and how it applies to a Zettelkasten. The main idea (as I understand it) is that when you build a complex system of notes, they appear unfinished and confusing when others view them, but to you, they‚Äôre useful and full of insight. It is the time and effort that makes the system useful and increases your understanding. When you move your Zettelkasten from one tool to another or analog to digital, you‚Äôre potentially replacing the core piece of what made it special.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We are now entering the paradox of the Ship of Theseus. Imagine a ship leaving the harbour with a certain set of parts. During the journey, parts break down and are replaced by new ones. When the ship returns home, all parts are replaced by new ones. Is the ship still the same? And if not: at which moment does the ship become another one? <a id=\"fnref:1\" class=\"footnote\" title=\"see footnote\" href=\"#fn:1\">[1]</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<div class=\"footnotes\"><hr />\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn:1\">\n<p><a href=\"https://zettelkasten.de/posts/ghost-in-the-box/\">Philosophy of Zettelkasten: What is the Ghost in the Box?</a> <a class=\"reversefootnote\" title=\"return to article\" href=\"#fnref:1\">¬†‚Ü©</a></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n",

I had problems loading the page content because the body text would fade the opacity from 0 to 1, but the 404 page wouldn‚Äôt load this CSS to do the transition. You can add <a title=\"customer 404\" href=\"https://help.micro.blog/t/custom-404-page/73/2\">your own custom 404 page</a> instead (if you choose). It is more flexible this way.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you have applied custom colors through the plugin settings, you may want to open your config.json and make a copy before updating.

				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>When it comes to my note-taking app, I have a few criteria.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Can I write in it? I‚Äôm talking about simple, distraction-free writing. Markdown support is necessary to write and add some basic formatting without leaving the keyboard.</li>\n<li>Can I get my notes out of it? I don‚Äôt want to use any application where I‚Äôll struggle to move my notes elsewhere.</li>\n<li>Is it available everywhere? As a user of Windows, Mac, and iOS, I need an app that will work everywhere.</li>\n<li>Is it flexible? Can I organize my notes by folders or tags? I don‚Äôt organize much and rely on search to find what I need. Some simple tags and a couple of folders suit my workflow.</li>\n<li>Can I easily publish my notes elsewhere? Sometimes it‚Äôs my blog. Sometimes it is to a PDF or some other application.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If I were only using a Mac, I‚Äôd probably use Bear for my notes. I love its clean and simple interface, speed, and export capabilities. But I‚Äôm also using Windows, so I‚Äôve been searching for an app that will meet my requirements.</p>\n<p>I have been using Evernote for years, and it checks some of the boxes. The biggest downside to Evernote is the note editor is not as clean as I would like, and getting notes out of Evernote can be a pain Although many apps import from Evernote, it‚Äôs not a great experience.</p>\n<p>Then I discovered <a title=\"UpNote\" href=\"https://getupnote.com\">UpNote</a>, a notes app similar to Bear. UpNote supports markdown and has a focus mode, making it a pleasure to write in. The sync is fast and reliable. It has plenty of features. I can organize by folder and tags. And it‚Äôs available on macOS, Windows, iOS, Android, and even Linux. I can export to various formats, including Markdown or PDF.</p>\n<p>What is UpNote missing? Well, on paper, it‚Äôs not missing much. In reality, a few things would make it perfect (for me). One is the ability to drag and drop notes into folders. Not a big deal. Since folders can be organized in any order, you can create sub-folders and even add colors and images to folder thumbnails, I‚Äôll let it slide. Maybe some more explore options and better Markdown export. When I copy Markdown into other apps, sometimes I have to fix some things.</p>\n<p>There is also something else that is missing that I can‚Äôt quite put my finger on. You may get some level of polish from apps like Bear or Ulysses. UpNote is a beautiful app, but if I were to compare the UI, Bear might be a 9 or 10, while UpNote is an 8 or 9. UpNote‚Äôs UI is beautiful but safe and not as exciting to use as other premium apps.</p>\n<p>I will stick with UpNote for a while and see if it meets my needs long-term. Let me know if you use the app yourself or know of any similar apps!</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>Evernote <a title=\"announced\" href=\"https://evernote.com/blog/evernote-next-move-joining-bending-spoons/\">announced</a>¬†Bending Spoons, a developer of mobile apps had acquired them. Bending Spoons is known for (or not known for) its mobile apps, including, Splice, Remini, and 30 Day Fitness.</p>\n<p>Like many, my first thoughts were, ‚Äúthis doesn‚Äôt make sense. Evernote is doomed!‚Äù. However, Bending Spoons must have the funds and technology to take Evernote to the next level. In a way, this is kind of exciting. Let‚Äôs hope they don‚Äôt blow it.</p>\n<p>What does this purchase mean for Evernote? It‚Äôs hard to say without knowing more about Bending Spoons. Looking through their website, it appears they‚Äôre heavily invested in AI (who isn‚Äôt these days). Adding some AI to Evernote could be pretty exciting. Evernote is already great (if not the best) at capturing and storing information. Adding AI to help connect notes, write text, update media, etc., could be a welcome addition. It‚Äôs also possible Bending Spoons does absolutely nothing with Evernote, and it‚Äôs business as usual.</p>\n<p>I‚Äôve been an Evernote user for over a decade and have accumulated nearly 7 thousand notes. Like many, Evernote has become a dumping ground where everything gets added to a massive black hole, never to be seen again. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, Evernote search is excellent, and with OCR, notebooks, and tags, users who like to use Evernote for their daily workflow have many options.</p>\n<p>I keep jumping into the Evernote app to see what‚Äôs new and occasionally to grab an old note. I just haven‚Äôt been able to stick with it lately because of the bloat. There are many other simple and sleeker tools out there today.</p>\n<p>I must admit that Evernote has come a long way in the past year or two after its massive rewrite. The app is pretty fast and responsive on all platforms. If it had better export and the ability to hide the features I don‚Äôt want to use, it would be tempting to use it full-time again. At this point, I‚Äôll wait to see how this acquisition turns out before jumping back in.</p>\n",

				"title": "4 things I love about Feedbin",
				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>I use a feed reader to pull in all the articles I‚Äôm interested in (using RSS), YouTube channels I subscribe to, social network lists, and even email newsletters. This allows me to avoid endless feeds, algorithms, and unwanted ads. When I read something, it is marked as read, and I don‚Äôt need to see it again.</p>\n<p>I‚Äôve tried several feed readers over the years since Google Reader was killed. The list includes Feedly, Inoreader, NetNewsWire, News Explorer, Reader, and others. Some of them have great features that I like. I especially liked the ability to take highlights and notes in Feedly pro, and they would sync automatically into my Readwise account.</p>\n<p>However, the feed reader I‚Äôve stuck with the longest is <a title=\"Feedbin\" href=\"http://feedbin.com\">Feedbin</a>. Why? I think there are a few reasons.</p>\n<h2 id=\"1feedbinissimple\">1) Feedbin is Simple</h2>\n<p>Feedbin doesn‚Äôt try to do too much. It has a simple and clean UI. You can use other Feed Readers with Feedbin, like <a title=\"Reeder\" href=\"https://reederapp.com\">Reeder</a>, <a title=\"Unread\" href=\"https://www.goldenhillsoftware.com/unread/\">Unread</a>, and many <a href=\"https://feedbin.com/apps\">others</a>. I find the Feedbin iOS apps are great and get the job done.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2feedbinsupportsnewsletters\">2) Feedbin supports newsletters</h2>\n<p>As I said, I now send all of my newsletters directly to Feedbin. This helps keep my email clean. I like the way Feedbin handles email newsletters. Rather than parsing the text, like it would most web articles, it gives me the option to show the newsletter in its original format, which I find better.</p>\n<p>Here is an example newsletter from <a title=\"NessLabs\" href=\"https://nesslabs.com\">Ness Labs</a>.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://ericgregorich.micro.blog/uploads/2022/9d094e3c73.png\" alt=\"Example Ness Labs newsletter shown in Feedbin\" />\n<figcaption>Example Ness Labs newsletter shown in Feedbin</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h2 id=\"3feedbinhandlestweetsandmicro.blogpostswell\">3) Feedbin handles Tweets and Micro.blog posts well</h2>\n<p>Feedbin lets you subscribe to Twitter users and lists, which is excellent in itself, but I love that I can click the little chat icon and see the entire thread directly in Feedbin.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://ericgregorich.micro.blog/uploads/2022/c48a1967bc.png\" alt=\"Example Tweet Thread in Feedbin\" />\n<figcaption>Example Tweet Thread in Feedbin</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>This also works with Micro.blog. If you add the <a title=\"Discover Feed\" href=\"https://micro.blog/discover\">Discover feed</a> or follow individual users, you click on the small Micro.blog icon to see the entire thread without leaving Feedbin.</p>\n<p>You still need to leave Feedbin and open the original post to reply. :(</p>\n<h2 id=\"4feedbinletsmesharedirectlytomicro.blogandothers\">4) Feedbin lets me share directly to Micro.blog and others</h2>\n<p>If I see something interesting while reading in Feedbin, I can easily share using the native Share Sheet or even share the link and my comments directly to my blog.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://ericgregorich.micro.blog/uploads/2022/dc9a2b475a.png\" alt=\"Example share with Micro.blog from Feedbin\" />\n<figcaption>Example share with Micro.blog from Feedbin</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p><a title=\"Feedbin\" href=\"http://feedbin.com\">Feedbin</a> is not perfect. It costs $50 per year (which I gladly pay), and it doesn‚Äôt have a native Mac app.</p>\n",

Instead, it is about how this ‚ÄúAttention Crisis‚Äù impacts society.</p>\n<p>Here are some of my notes about the author‚Äôs points in this book.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatimpactisthisattentioncrisishavingonourlives\">What impact is this Attention Crisis having on our lives?</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>We‚Äôre finding it harder to find ‚ÄúFlow,‚Äù during which we become engrossed in an activity without disruptions.</li>\n<li>With all the tiny bits of information continuously flowing into our lives, it becomes less likely that we‚Äôll read books.</li>\n<li>It‚Äôs harder to think because we don‚Äôt allow our minds to wonder as much as we should. Mind wandering is a critical stage in which our brain has insights, makes connections, and plans for the future.</li>\n<li>Technology is becoming better at keeping us distracted. The more we look at their service, the more money the company makes, so they manipulate us to keep us engaged.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"whatiscontributingtothisattentioncrisis\">What is contributing to this Attention Crisis?</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>We‚Äôre bombarded with chemicals that harm our health and, ultimately, our attention.</li>\n<li>Failing to explore ADHD. More people than ever are diagnosed with ADHD, yet we‚Äôve prescribed medications rather than solving the causes.</li>\n<li>Our children are not allowed to explore and play like in the past. They‚Äôre no longer playing in the streets and wandering the neighborhood. They‚Äôre told precisely what to do in school and what the outcome should be rather than allowing creative learning.</li>\n<li>We‚Äôre not getting enough sleep due to artificial light and consumer capitalism. We‚Äôre spending too much time flipping through Tick-Tock videos rather than going to bed at a decent time and allowing our brains to recover and make connections during sleep.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"howdowerecover\">How do we recover?</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Fewer work hours to allow us more time to rest and recover.</li>\n<li>Allow our children more time to play and explore, especially at school.</li>\n<li>Change our technology to be less disruptive to our lives. Yet, the companies building it do not have an incentive to do so unless regulations are established, which is an entirely different issue.</li>\n<li>Take it upon ourselves to control what we consume, get more sleep and exercise, and spend quality time reading and just being bored. It‚Äôs good for us!</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a title=\"Stolen Focus\" href=\"https://amzn.to/3Uaacpe\">Get Stolen Focus on Amazon</a>.</p>\n",

Yet, the author explains, it‚Äôs part of how we learn and create.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>‚ÄúCreativity is not where you create some new thing that‚Äôs emerged from your brain.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a new association between two things already there.‚Äù Mind-wandering allows ‚Äúmore extended trains of thought to unfold, which allows for more associations to be made.‚Äù - Stolen Focus p96</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>While this is nothing new, it caught my attention because I daydream. Ever since I was a kid, I would get in trouble for not paying attention. I suppose my excuse now is, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm creating something!‚Äù.</p>\n<p>Mind wandering is a necessary part of how our brains work. For example, as we read, we focus on the words. Our mind tries to make connections to the ideas we‚Äôre reading about. We may think of past experiences, related reading, or even contradictions. This is precisely what we should be doing. This part of reading helps us learn and make sense of things.</p>\n<p>Of course, we can easily take our minds wandering too far when we‚Äôre trying to read but keep thinking about checking Twitter or what‚Äôs for dinner. In these cases, we‚Äôre getting into distraction territory.</p>\n",

While The Martian‚Äôs story is grounded in the science we understand today, Project Hail Mary goes beyond that and adds more sci-fi without breaking the rules of science.</p>\n<p>The other difference between The Martian and Project Hail Mary is the scope. In The Martian, Mark Watney is stranded on Mars and needs to figure out how to get home. In Project Hail Mary, the Sun is being destroyed by a phenomenon, and Ryland Grace must travel to a distant star to figure out how to save Earth.</p>\n<p>The protagonist, Ryland Grace, is a science teacher who ends up as the sole survivor of the Hail Mary as it travels to its destination, where we hope to figure out how to save Earth. Ryland wakes from a coma with no memory of how he got there or even who he is. Fortunately, his memory comes back over time.</p>\n<p>As Ryland solves one problem after another aboard the Hail Mary, his memories slowly return. We see the planning of the Project Hail Mary mission on Earth and how Ryland was ‚Äúchosen‚Äù for the mission. We also see the sacrifices that are made to make the mission happen.</p>\n<p>The writing is engaging and fun. While much math is involved, you can get the point without understanding it. It all makes sense. This is one of the special things about Andy Weir‚Äôs writing style. You can tell he loves this stuff. He spent a lot of time researching and discussing ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù scenarios with real scientists and astronauts. After the success of The Martian, he likely has a pool of resources available to him.</p>\n<p>This story is not your typical sci-fi. I felt like this could happen. Ryland‚Äôs problems were science-based and felt realistic instead of forced plot twists to make the story exciting. Many times in this book, I imagined all of the things that could have been done if this were an action sci-fi story that we would typically see. Instead, we get a great story about a guy working out extraordinary problems.</p>\n<p>I enjoyed this book.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>‚ÄúWorking the problem‚Äù - NASA</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>By the way, a Project Hail Mary movie is being made, starring Ryan Gosling.</p>\n",

				"title": "The true purpose of a Zettelkasten",
				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>A Zettelkasten is a German word that translates to ‚Äúslip box.‚Äù The term became used to describe a particular workflow that Niklas Luhmann used to publish about 50 books and 550 articles over his career.</p>\n<p>Many great articles are out there describing Niklas Luhmann‚Äôs Zettelkasten system. As well as a few books, so I won‚Äôt go into those details here. Instead, I want to focus on the key concepts I realized about a Zettelkasten over time.</p>\n<p>A Zettelkasten is a box of notes. Luhmann‚Äôs workflow to take and organize notes became synonymous with Zettelkasten. When we hear the word Zettelkasten today, we think of the workflow process, not necessarily a box of index cards.</p>\n<p>S√∂nke Ahrens helped make the Zettelkasten popular with his book How To Take Smart Notes. S√∂nke introduced the names of the various types of notes, Fleeting, Literature, Permanent, and Project, to describe the various phases of Luhmann‚Äôs workflow. However, these names were never part of Luhmann‚Äôs vocabulary to describe his system (in fact, Luhmann rarely talked about his workflow).</p>\n<p>Digital tools try to mimic the Zettelkasten workflow that Luhmann used. However, digital tools have many advantages that make some parts of his analog workflow seem wasteful, such as numbering and limiting space to what fits on a 4x6 card. We can now easily connect notes using Wiki Links, see connections using Backlinks, see a graph of notes related to the current note, and even see a visual of the entire system to identify clusters of information. Not to mention full-text search and hyperlinks!</p>\n<p>While we can take advantage of these digital tools, we need to remember the fundamental purpose of the Zettelkasten. It‚Äôs not to make as many notes and connections as we can to grow an enormous graph that will somehow start answering all of our questions and do the writing for us.</p>\n<div class=\"kg-card kg-callout-card kg-callout-card-blue\">\n<div class=\"kg-callout-text\">Luhmann‚Äôs Zettelkasten system worked because it forced him to slow down and think about each idea and how it relates to the other ideas. Numbering each card to connect it to another card was a painstaking process, which required him to spend more time organizing his notes than actually writing his publications. This gave him the time (in his head) to make real connections and insights. Digital tools can easily abstract this from us if we‚Äôre not careful.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"kg-card kg-callout-card kg-callout-card-green\">\n<div class=\"kg-callout-text\">Another reason Luhmann created so much content is that throughout his process, he spent time creating output that would be used in his work.

				"content_text": "<p><a href=\"https://raindrop.io\">Raindrop.io</a> has become one of those apps that I use nearly every day. With so much content on the web, we need a place to save what we find helpful. Raindrop does just that. It is a bookmarking service that works on nearly any device and browser.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Save and recall interesting content.</li>\n<li>Save articles and videos to read or watch later.</li>\n<li>Read articles and make highlights and annotations. <a href=\"https://readwise.io/raindrop_syncing\">Sync highlights</a> with <a href=\"https://readwise.io/\">Readwise</a>.</li>\n<li>Save inspirational images.</li>\n<li>Share bookmarks with others.</li>\n<li>Create an RSS feed of a collection that can be shared and consumed in other applications.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"platforms\">Platforms</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Browser Extension for Chrome, Edge, Safari, Firefox, and Brave.</li>\n<li>Mobile app for iPhone, iPad, and Android.</li>\n<li>Desktop app for macOS, Windows, and Linux.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"organization\">Organization</h2>\n<p>Raindrop allows you to create Collections (Folders) and Tags. With the Pro version, you can create nested collections. You can also create Groups to help organize your collections.</p>\n<p>I have been using the <a href=\"https://fortelabs.co/blog/para/\">PARA</a> method to provide a straightforward way to organize content. I like to keep it simple.</p>\n<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img class=\"kg-image\" src=\"https://ericgregorich.micro.blog/uploads/2022/9e177e74a6.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></figure>\n<ul>\n<li>Unsorted: Things I want to read or watch later. They‚Äôll often be deleted unless they‚Äôre worth keeping, then I‚Äôll send them to another collection and add some tags.</li>\n<li>Shared: I have a shared collection of Microsoft and <a href=\"https://raindrop.io/egregorich/focustivity-resources-26717462/search\">Focustivity bookmarks</a>.</li>\n<li>Projects: I create a collection for each project where I gather links and web content. I don‚Äôt usually have many projects of this type.</li>\n<li>Areas: A collection for each area of my life. I‚Äôll store manuals, links to important sites, and other things here.</li>\n<li>Resources: This is where most of my bookmarks go. I have a single Resources collection that I dump everything into. I add a couple of tags to make it easier to filter later.</li>\n<li>Archive: Where I keep archived projects.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"highlights\">Highlights</h2>\n<p>One of my favorite features in Raindrop is the Highlights. Once installed with the browser extension, you can highlight text on a page and save the highlight directly to Raindrop. You can also use this feature now in Raindrop (like the image below). Select a webpage, highlight some text, and add annotations if you want.</p>\n<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img class=\"kg-image\" src=\"https://ericgregorich.micro.blog/uploads/2022/2295115915.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></figure>\n<p>These highlights can <a href=\"https://readwise.io/raindrop_syncing\">sync to Readwise</a> (this feature was not announced at the time of this post).</p>\n<h2 id=\"search\">Search</h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://help.raindrop.io/using-search/\">search</a> functionality is pretty solid, featuring Full-Text search meaning it will find content within your bookmarks and PDFs. You can use the filters to quickly select a tag, date, type, or other criteria.</p>\n<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img class=\"kg-image\" src=\"https://ericgregorich.micro.blog/uploads/2022/13201232e0.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></figure>\n<h2 id=\"pricing\">Pricing</h2>\n<p>The pricing of Raindrop is reasonable. I think most people can get by with the free version, which includes unlimited bookmarks, collections, highlights, and most features.</p>\n<p>The pro version provides extra features like full-text search, nested collections, annotations, duplicate link finder, automatic backups, 10Gb files per month, and priority email support.</p>\n<h2 id=\"who-is-raindrop-for\">Who is Raindrop for?</h2>\n<p>Raindrop is not going to be a replacement for an academic research tool like Zotero, where you will need citations, PDF annotations, and integrations to note applications like Obsidian.</p>\n<p>For anyone who wants to save bookmarks, and does some light highlighting and annotations, then Raindrop is a great option.</p>\n",

All the app does is give you seven screens to write text.</p>\n<p>Are you blown away yet?</p>\n<p>Yeah, it sounds pretty simple. Then when you mention the $19.99 price tag, you will laugh.</p>\n<p>What this app does is extremely simple, yet it fits a need that I‚Äôve been looking for. I wanted a standalone app that gives me a page of text I can write on throughout the day. I keep notes, tasks, links, clipboard text, and all kinds of things on this page. This page syncs across devices, including my phone, so I can quickly update it throughout the day.</p>\n<p>Using a ‚ÄúWorking Memory‚Äù text file on your computer is nothing new. In his podcast, Cal Newport talks about it and has an <a href=\"https://www.calnewport.com/blog/2015/10/27/deep-habits-workingmemory-txt-the-most-important-productivity-tool-youve-never-heard-of/\">article</a> explaining his method.</p>\n<p>When using only Microsoft Windows, I would use Notepad all the time for this. Now that I‚Äôm on Mac, I tried using an Apple Note or a simple document that syncs across devices. I think the biggest problem I had with them is there were too many options. I did more formatting and playing around with the note than just using it.</p>\n<p>I only just started using Tot Pocket. So far, I like it. The sync is fast and reliable and has just enough features to allow me to jot down notes and tasks throughout the day without being distracted.</p>\n",

Eventually, you‚Äôll end up with a menu bar that spans the width of your monitor, which is distracting.</p>\n<p>Bartender allows you to configure this menu, only showing the icons you want to see and hiding the rest under a menu.</p>\n<h3 id=\"cleanmymac-x\">CleanMyMac X</h3>\n<p>I‚Äôm constantly installing and uninstalling applications, testing to see what they do and if they help me. Unfortunately, this leaves clutter on the MAC, including files and folders and other settings that get left behind even when you uninstall.</p>\n<p>CleanMyMac helps remove all of this unnecessary clutter from your Mac.</p>\n<h3 id=\"bettersnaptool\">BetterSnapTool</h3>\n<p>I have a widescreen monitor, and the biggest thing I missed from Windows is the ability to snap my windows to various positions on the screen.</p>\n<p>BetterSnapTool does this on the Mac. You can easily position your apps and create custom areas for them to snap. Very handy!</p>\n<p>Some alternatives are Mosaic and Magnet. I‚Äôve begun using Raycast to manage my windows using keyboard shortcuts, which I‚Äôm enjoying.</p>\n<h3 id=\"cleanshot-x\">CleanShot X</h3>\n<p>CleanShot X provides some excellent screen-capture capabilities. Quickly take screenshots, annotate them, then share them.</p>\n<h2 id=\"great-apps-exclusive-to-the-apple-ecosystem\">Great apps, exclusive to the Apple Ecosystem</h2>\n<p>One of the biggest reasons I switched to a Mac for my setup is the great apps. It feels like apps on Windows are an afterthought and are usually only ported web applications anyway.</p>\n<h3 id=\"things-3\">Things 3</h3>\n<p>Things 3 is probably one of the most elegant task management applications.</p>\n<h3 id=\"bear\">Bear</h3>\n<p>My favorite writing and note-taking application, Bear, is a straightforward markdown-based app that lets you focus on writing. You can organize your notes using tags.</p>\n<h3 id=\"craft\">Craft</h3>\n<p>Craft may arguably be the best all-purpose note-taking and documentation creation app. It is simple to use and has a beautiful design, and I use it to organize my life.</p>\n<h3 id=\"fantastical\">Fantastical</h3>\n<p>Fantastical is an excellent calendar app that goes beyond the out-of-the-box Apple calendar. Its most prominent feature may be the autocomplete functionality, and you can type an event or task in natural language, which will set all the details for you!</p>\n<p>I‚Äôve only been using the Mac for a few weeks. I hope what I shared is useful. What are your favorite apps and tricks for the Mac? I‚Äôd love to learn more.</p>\n",

Your mind and body and simple and don‚Äôt need extravagance.</li>\n<li>Nature will always change to do what is best for nature. You are part of nature. Trust the change.</li>\n<li>You have limited time in this world. Don‚Äôt spend it procrastinating on things of importance.</li>\n<li>Focus on things as if it was the last thing you will do in life.</li>\n<li>You have one life, and it‚Äôs almost over.</li>\n<li>Take the time to learn things for yourself and less for others.</li>\n<li>Listen to your heart, and find your happiness.</li>\n<li>No one can prevent you from being in harmony with nature.</li>\n<li>Sinning out of desire is worse than doing so out of anger. Passion comes from within, and anger is caused by something external.</li>\n<li>Death happens to both good and bad people; therefore, how could it be a bad thing? How could death be punishment for people who are good all of their lives?</li>\n<li>Objects are temporary and meaningless.</li>\n<li>People deserve our affection because they are like us, people.</li>\n<li>You cannot lose the future or the past, only the present.</li>\n<li>‚ÄúEverything is just an impression‚Äù - Monimus the Cynic</li>\n<li>The soul degrades when it becomes upset with things that happen, you turn your back on another when you experience too much pleasure or pain, when you act false, and when your actions are without purpose.</li>\n<li>Be true to yourself without depending on others. You can‚Äôt control nature, perception, the nature of the body, the soul.</li>\n</ol>\n",
