				"title": "Back to physical books",
				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>I've been a long-time user of Kindle and Audible, with a few physical books thrown in here and there in an attempt to determine my preference between physical or digital formats. I think the truth is that I like both, as each has its advantages.</p>\n<p>Digital is convenient.</p>\n<p>There is no doubt that the ability to pull up a book on my phone from anywhere to continue reading is very convenient.</p>\n<p>However, this convenience comes at a cost.</p>\n<p>Digital formats make it easy to blindly highlight and bookmark without revisiting. Then services, like Readwise, absorb those highlights and compile them into a massive personal database of all your highlights.</p>\n<p>In theory, this is extremely helpful. Some people undoubtedly couldn't manage any other way. They process these highlights as if there's no tomorrow and make connections to all their other notes.</p>\n<p>However, this method is not for me.</p>\n<p>I tend to get caught up in the \"system\" and lose the enjoyment of reading.</p>\n<p>I've also experienced this with podcasts. I was using the Snipd podcast player for a while, thinking I would create highlights of interesting things. The app works great, as it has some AI to make snipping highlights from audio easy.</p>\n<p>However, I found that listening to a podcast had become a chore.</p>\n<p>While there are no guarantees that I won't go down that road again, I'm currently stepping back and using physical books for a while.</p>\n<p>This doesn't mean I won't be taking notes on my books. I'm using Cal Newport's method of marking up a book. It involves simply making a mark in the corner of a page that has something useful and adding a line next to the paragraph.</p>\n<p>The purpose of this approach is more about making the content easy to revisit when I need it (if ever), rather than trying to process everything I find interesting into my system.</p>\n<p>This is something I've been calling \"Just In Time Note Taking\". I essentially bookmark what I find interesting so I can get back to it later if I ever need it. This contrasts with \"Just In Case Note Taking\", where I take notes on everything right away, which is very time-consuming and often unnecessary.</p>\n<p>Back to reading!</p>\n",

Obviously, you'll want to add your own content.\n\n```html\n<div class=\"h-card vcard\" style=\"display:none\"> \n    <span class=\"p-name\">Your full name</span>\n    <span class=\"p-given-name\">Your given name</span>\n    <abbr class=\"p-additional-name\">Your additional name</abbr>\n    <span class=\"p-family-name\">Your family. name</span>\n    <img class=\"u-photo\" src=\"url to your profile picture\"/>\n    <a class=\"u-url\" href=\"url to your website\">Website</a>,\n    <a class=\"u-email\" href=\"mailto:your email address\">Email</a>\n    <div class=\"p-country-name\">Your country</div>\n    <div class=\"p-note\">A brief bio about you.</div>\n</div>\n```\n\nThe key is to define the class values and nest them inside the h-card class. Notice the display: none means my h-card is hidden on the page. You can remove this if you want to display it and change the HTML and CSS to your liking.\n",

Of course, all my highlights and notes are synced to Readwise.</p>\n<h2 id=\"readwise\">Readwise</h2>\n<p>All content is synced into Readwise where I occasionally review my notes and highlights. Instead of exporting everything to another tool such as Obsidian or Reflect, I prefer keeping them in Readwise to separate others’ content from mine.</p>\n<h2 id=\"reflect\">Reflect.app</h2>\n<p>I’m testing <a href=\"https://reflect.app\">Reflect.app</a>, drawn in by its simple interface, daily notes, calendar integration, end-to-end encryption, local-first approach, and advanced AI. If the experiment proves successful, it could potentially replace Ulysses and even Grammarly as my primary writing tools.</p>\n<p>The objective is to create a library of reusable content that I can utilize for documentation, emails, estimates, development, code snippets, essay writing, and much more. I don’t subscribe to the “Zettelkasten” method per se. I just want a repository of content I create.</p>\n<h2 id=\"onthechoppingblock\">On the chopping block</h2>\n<h3 id=\"raindrop\">Raindrop</h3>\n<p>I’m still using Raindrop for bookmarks. I use it less though since Readwise Reader has taken over as my reference for external content. I still bookmark interesting apps, blogs, and other sites that I enjoy. I plan to start capturing those in Reflect and see if that works as a replacement.</p>\n<p>Bookmarks for “launching” things can easily be kept in my browser.</p>\n<h3 id=\"grammarly\">Grammarly</h3>\n<p>I’ve used Grammarly for years but canceled my subscription last month (effective today I discovered as I write this :)).</p>\n<p>I use Microsoft Editor for work, which is not as good as Grammarly but is integrated into most Microsoft tools.</p>\n<p>I’ve shifted from Grammarly to other AI tools like Reflect, which has built-in grammar checking, making the $144 annual Grammarly fee harder to justify.</p>\n<h3 id=\"feedbin\">Feedbin</h3>\n<p>I enjoy using Feedbin for its RSS reading due to its simple UI and adequate features. However, Readwise Reader is now my preference as it streamlines my workflow.</p>\n",

This only evaluates what’s happening with your health <em>now</em>. You need to be proactive if you want to live longer. If you want to play the long-game with your life, you need to start with your objective, then define a strategy, then define tactics.</p>\n<p>Your <strong>objectives</strong> would inlude defining what you want to be able to do in your old age. Common examples include picking up and playing with grandchildren, walking your dog, not be in pain, etc.</p>\n<p>You then reverse-engineer your objectives and create a <strong>strategy</strong>.  The strategy is the higher level approach to how you will achieve your goals. What will you learn, what ways will you approach the problems.</p>\n<p>The <strong>tactics</strong> are the things you do day-to-day and week-to-week that will help you achieve your objective.</p>\n<h2 id=\"insulin-resistance\">Insulin Resistance</h2>\n<p>Insulin resistance is a major contributor to cancer, Alzheimer&rsquo;s, heart disease, and other medical conditions. It occurs when the body&rsquo;s cells don&rsquo;t respond correctly to insulin, which results in too much glucose entering the muscles and organs.</p>\n<p>Surprisingly, exercise is the most effective way to combat insulin resistance, not nutrition.</p>\n<h2 id=\"zone-2-training\">Zone 2 Training</h2>\n<p>Zone 2 training involves low-intensity exercise that is active enough for you to have a conversation without running out of breath. It is typically 70-85% of your peak heart rate.</p>\n<p>During Zone 2, most of the work is done by your &ldquo;slow-twitch&rdquo; muscles that are rich in mitochondria. The mitochondria are “the power plants of the cell” and Zone 2 training can help them use fat as fuel.</p>\n<p>To benefit and improve your health, you need at least 3 hours of Zone 2 training per week, split into four 45-minute sessions.</p>\n<h2 id=\"vo2-max-training\">VO2 Max Training</h2>\n<p>VO2 Max is the highest rate at which a person can use oxygen during strenuous exercise. It is an indicator of aerobic fitness and endurance performance.</p>\n<p>Achieving VO2 Max can be done by working at maximum intensity for four minutes, followed by a four-minute rest period. Repeat this cycle four times per week and measure your VO2 Max annually to measure progress. Apple Health and other fitness trackers have built-in VO2 Max measurements, though they may be less accurate than tests you can get at a medical facility.</p>\n<p>Having a VO2 Max below average doubles the risk of death, which is even greater than the risk posed by smoking.</p>\n<p>If your new to exercising, focus on Zone 2 Training for 6 months before starting VO2 Max Training.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>VO2 Max is perhaps the most powerful marker for longevity. - Peter Attia, MD</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"strength-training\">Strength Training</h2>\n<p>Strength training increases muscle mass, which uses excess glucose. As we age, we lose muscle, so the more muscle mass we can build while we&rsquo;re younger, the more we&rsquo;ll have stored for our later years.</p>\n<p>To maximize the benefits of strength training, perform exercises 3 days per week with a focus on grip strength. Examples of exercises that target concentric, eccentric, and isometric strength include farmer&rsquo;s carry, deadlifts, and more. Eccentric strength is especially important to prevent injuries, such as the ability to stop yourself from falling.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s also important to note that strength training is not effective if we don&rsquo;t consume enough protein in our diet. Aim for about 1g of protein per pound of total body weight per day (2.2g/kg/day).</p>\n<h2 id=\"stability-training\">Stability Training</h2>\n<p>Stability is essential for training, as it helps to prevent injury and is necessary for strength and performance. When we lack stability, we might be strong, but we are wasting energy in the wrong places, such as joints and other muscles, which prevents us from reaching our full potential. <sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</a></sup></p>\n<p>To ensure stability, dedicate 10-15 minutes of your day to stability training and one hour twice a week. Focus on Dynamic Neuromuscular Stabilization (DNS), which is based on natural movements.. <sup id=\"fnref:2\"><a href=\"#fn:2\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">2</a></sup></p>\n<h2 id=\"nutrition\">Nutrition</h2>\n<p>When it comes to nutrition, there are some key principles to follow. One of them is getting enough protein. Protein is the most important macronutrient and we often don&rsquo;t consume enough of it. As we age, it becomes even more important to aim for 1g/lb/day (2.2g/kg/day) of protein, based on our current body weight. This should be spread out throughout the day, as excess protein can be converted into glucose.</p>\n<p>In addition to protein, strive to eat healthy most of the time. Whole foods are preferable to processed food. However, the best approach is to monitor your own nutrition and adjust according to what works for you.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Getting nutrition wrong has far more negative consequences than getting it right. <sup id=\"fnref:3\"><a href=\"#fn:3\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">3</a></sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"sleep\">Sleep</h2>\n<p>We need to sleep between 7 1/2 and 8 1/2 hours each night. Sleep deprivation can lead to insulin resistance. High stress can lead to poor sleep, which can further increase stress levels.</p>\n<p>Studies show that sleeping less than 6 hours is associated with a 20% higher risk of heart attack. People who sleep less during middle age years are more likely to develop dementia later in life.</p>\n<p>A couple of hours before bedtime, turn off unnecessary lights, especially LED, and replace blue lights with warmer colored lights. Get at least half an hour of sunlight during the day, which will also help with sleep.

Since my keyboard and mouse are both Logitech, I can easily move my mouse between monitors by moving it to the edge of the screen while holding the CTR key. This works between Windows and Mac machines seamlessly. </p>\n<h2>Keyboard and Mouse</h2>\n<p>Logitech <a href=\"https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/keyboards/mx-mechanical.html\">MX Mechanical Mini</a> and <a href=\"https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/mice/mx-vertical-ergonomic-mouse.910-005447.html\">Logitech MX Vertical</a>.</p>\n<h2>Time Tracking</h2>\n<p>That white octagon-shaped thing is from <a href=\"https://timeular.com\">Timeular</a>.

				"title": "Exploring Microsoft Edge: A Week-Long Experiment",
				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>This week, I put myself through another experiment and used the Microsoft Edge browser exclusively for work and personal.</p>\n<p>I’ve used Microsoft Edge for work for various reasons and never really had any issues with it. For personal, I was using Safari, but I’ve also experimented with Brave, Firefox, and even Arc.</p>\n<p>With all the recent announcements around the <a href=\"https://www.bing.com/new\">new Bing</a> and other features coming to Microsoft Edge, I thought I would try to use the browser for work and personal for at least a week.</p>\n<p>I’ve been pleasantly surprised! No performance issues or crashes. That is to be expected since I’m already using it for work all day long.</p>\n<p>But there are some features that I started to use that have been surprisingly helpful.</p>\n<h2>Verticle Tabs</h2>\n<p>I don’t leave tabs open, so I don’t have much issue managing them, but the verticle tabs give the browser a clean look that I like.</p>\n<h2>Profiles</h2>\n<p>I’ve been using profiles for work since the feature was released. Profiles allow you to quickly switch to a separate instance of Edge with its logins, sessions, cookies, bookmarks, etc. This is ideal for separating work from personal, but I also have about 15 profiles for various clients, and I can log into their Office 365 environment with a click.</p>\n<h2>The Side Bar</h2>\n<p>When the Side Bar feature was first released, I immediately disabled it and never looked back. However, this week I gave it a try. It is pretty handy for searches and even loading specific sites, and I’ve used it with Feedbin, Micro.blog, and Mastodon. It’s a little glitchy when navigating, but it is convenient for quickly checking email or social updates.</p>\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"Microsoft Edge Screenshot.png\" src=\"https://ericgregorich.com/uploads/2023/b0f95d942e.png\" alt=\"Microsoft Edge Screenshot\" width=\"772\" height=\"600\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<h2>Shopping</h2>\n<p>Another feature I had immediately disabled prior but thought I would give a go over the past week is the Shopping integration. Annoying or helpful? If you want to save some money, it can be beneficial. You can even track orders and price changes. Will I continue using it? 🤔 To be decided...</p>\n<h2>Cross-Device</h2>\n<p>Yes, I’ve also been using Microsoft Edge on my phone and tablet, and it’s okay. I prefer Safari for its simplicity, but the Edge mobile apps work great, and having everything synced across devices is excellent.</p>\n<h2>AI Integration</h2>\n<p>It’s too soon to say whether AI integration is helpful, and the features are not released yet. There were <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOeRWRJ16yY&t=1s\">announcements</a> about Bing AI being baked into Microsoft Edge, so you can use it as you browse. Another helpful yet scary feature.</p>\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"Bing AI in Microsoft Edge.png\" src=\"https://ericgregorich.com/uploads/2023/701a858230.png\" alt=\"Bing AI in Microsoft Edge\" width=\"779\" height=\"452\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<h2>What I don’t like about Microsoft Edge</h2>\n<p>Of course, there are many things I still don’t like about Microsoft Edge. Microsoft tries to add every feature under the sun to the browser, causing it to be bloated. I know how to turn most things off, so it’s manageable.</p>\n<p>Privacy and Security is also a concern. While edge has many features that make your browsing more secure, you have to accept that Microsoft has at least some telemetry data from you. Who knows for sure what they’re tracking? If that is a concern, look elsewhere.</p>\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"Microsoft Edge Privacy Settings.png\" src=\"https://ericgregorich.com/uploads/2023/530102d724.png\" alt=\"Microsoft Edge Privacy Settings\" width=\"429\" height=\"600\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<h2>Will I continue using Microsoft Edge?</h2>\n<p>Yes, until I get bored with it and want to try something else. I’m still trying to grasp all the features available and how they compare to other browsers.</p>\n",

But today, we don't use this additional energy like we used to, and it causes us to hold onto the fat we generate.\n\n### Attentional Space (p201)\n\n> Attentional Space is our working memory capacity ... the more mental space we have to work with, the deeper we can think, the more we can process at one time, and the better we perform.\n\n### Measuring Productivity (p211)\n\n> The trick to measuring productivity is to reflect on how much you accomplish.\n\nIt isn’t easy to measure productivity in any other way. Gauging by the time spent or widgets produced is not a good reflection of whether we're productive. We must reflect on our day and decide for ourselves if we are productive. Productivity is about doing what we intend to do.\n\n## Action Items\n\n- Define productivity hours\n- Make a stress inventory.\n- Make a list of things I savor.\n- Execute a month-long dopamine fast.\n- Incorporate movement daily.\n- Meditate daily.\n- Cut out or cut back on caffeine.\n\n",

It’s too cognitively expensive and not rewarding enough. For an old note to be helpful it needs to be presented to Future You in a way that clicks into what you’re working on instantly—with as little processing as possible.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As you consume content and take generic notes, the AI can transform it into more meaningful text, autocomplete the thought, apply context, and organize it, making it easy to find again.</p>\n<p>As you create content, AI could show your notes as you type. Imagine typing about a topic, and the AI presents the notes to you as you type, as it applies to the current context.</p>\n<p>Many note and reading apps already incorporate AI, including Readwise, Mem, Mymind, Craft, and Notion. Some with plugins that add this, including Obsidian and Logseq. It should quickly evolve to the point envisioned in this essay.</p>\n<p>This essay does not account for the act of writing as a way to help you think and learn. If we let AI do the lifting for us, does that make us smarter, or do we lose the ability to think for ourselves? There is a fine line.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>Have you ever started an email to someone that explains a problem to them, one that you don’t know the solution to, then by the time you finish the email, you’ve realized you have come up with a solution?</p>\n<p>Simply writing out a problem where the explanation is as simple as possible (so someone else can understand it), we are clarifying in our mind precisely what the problem is. You likely don’t understand if you can’t explain the situation to someone else.</p>\n<p>Understanding the problem is only the first part. Now we try to come up with a solution. Often there are multiple solutions. So, we start listing some potential solutions and thinking through the pros and cons of each solution.</p>\n<p>As we write out the potential options to solve the problem, we often eliminate specific options based on what we know about the situation. Perhaps it is a budget issue or an infrastructure limitation. The more we can get down on paper (digital or analog) more likely we are to come up with the best options.</p>\n<p>As a Software Architect, this happens to me all the time. So much that I’ve incorporated this into my workflow. When I need to deal with a problem, even if I think I understand the problem, I write it out in the most straightforward explanation possible. Then each option will have pros and cons, and I’ll usually have a recommendation of which option I think would work best or is most reasonable within the current circumstances.</p>\n<p>After going through this process, I’ve often solved the problem and realized the best solution we can implement immediately. Clients love being told there was a problem and that you already took care of it. There is also the added benefit of having everything documented.</p>\n<p>I’ll write on paper when I’m struggling with something I can’t wrap my head around. This slows me down, so I can spend time thinking as I go. When writing on a computer, it’s easy to spit out words that don’t have as much meaning. On the flip side, a computer makes it easier to delete and reorganize ideas.</p>\n<p>Writing out our problems is not only for technical issues; it can work for anything. This is why Journaling is so beneficial.</p>\n<p>Writing is thinking.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "My notes on the book [Building a Second Brain by Tiago Forte](https://amzn.to/3ovAm8a). Overall, the book is solid. If you already have an organized digital system, you may pick up some tips from the book to help you think through your current setup. If you have no system, then this system is a great place to start, as it is flexible and straightforward.\n\n## What is a Second Brain?\n\nTiago defines the Second Brain as a digital commonplace book, a multipurpose tool that can adapt to your needs and extend your mind. It consists of knowledge-building blocks you can combine to assist you when creating something.\n\n## How a Second Brain Works.\n\nThere are four things we can expect our Second Brain to do for us:\n\n1. Establish our ideas.\n2. Connect ideas.\n3. Incubate ideas over time, what Tiago calls the \"slow burn.\"\n4. Sharpen our perspective.\n\nThere are three stages of progress during the development of our Second Brain.\n\n1. Remembering\n2. Connecting\n3. Creating.\n\nThe Second Brain consists of a four-part method called \"CODE\" - Capture, Organize, Distill, and Express.\n\n## Capture - Keep What Resonates\n\n### Capture when:\n\n1. It inspires you.\n2. It is useful.\n3. It is personal.\n4. It is surprising.\n\n### Don't capture when:\n\n1. It's sensitive information.\n2. It requires special formats that need a dedicated app.\n3. It is a large file that requires a dedicated app to open.\n4. Content that will require collaboration.\n\n### How to capture:\n\n1. Add highlights to your ebook reader.\n2. Save articles and web pages to a read-later app that allows highlights.\n3. Clip quotes from podcasts.\n4. Capture voice memos from your phone.\n5. Use the transcripts in YouTube videos.\n6. Capture excerpts from email.\n7. Capture from other apps using the Share button or copy-and-paste.\n\n## Organize - Save for Actionability\n\n### PARA\n\nOrganize your work into one of these four folders. Your organizing for actionability. Projects; Areas; Resources; Archives.\n\nAny notes and files you use for your \"Second Brain\" can be organized into these 4 folders (regardless of which application you use). Try to be consistent across applications.\n\n### Projects\n\nProjects have start and end dates. They are actionable. Everything from a work project to reading a book should be a project.\n\n\"By structuring your notes and files around completing your active projects, your knowledge can go to work for you instead of collecting dust like an \"idea graveyard.\" (Tiago Forte, Building a Second Brain)\n\n### Areas\n\nAreas are long-term responsibilities that may not even have an end date—for instance, Finances, Health, Family, etc.\n\nThe content you store in these folders could be more actionable but is needed for reference, for example, Tax papers, family budgets, inspirational photos, automobile information, manuals, warranty information, insurance information, etc.\n\n### Resources\n\nResources contain content you want to use as reference material for any topic you are interested in.\n\nIf you start a project and find some relevant existing Resources, move them to the project folder. When the project is complete, you may transfer these notes and files back to the Resources folder.\n\n### Archive\n\nThe Archive is where you move completed or canceled projects or even areas you are no longer responsible for. Even Resources that are no longer relevant to you.\n\n### Tags\n\nTiago does not recommend using Tags as a primary way to organize content. They can be used to organize by status or type.\n\n\"I don't recommend using tags as your primary organizational system. It takes far too much energy to apply tags to every single note compared to the ease of searching with keywords or browsing your folders.\" (Tiago Forte, Building a Second Brain)\n\n## Distill - Find the Essence\n\nIt's essential to update your notes to make them discoverable. Otherwise, they'll be missed when you need them. We make them discoverable by going through the Distill process.\n\nWe want to capture only some of the article and have to work through it when we want to find a specific piece of information. Instead, we should grasp the essential ideas.\n\n### Progressive Summarization\n\n- When capturing, highlight the main points.\n- At a later time, review your highlights and bold the main points within those highlights.\n- After that, review the highlights again and create an executive summary using bullet points at the top of the note in your own words.\n\n\"The bolds and highlights of Progressive Summarization help me quickly determine which parts are most interesting and important at a glance.\" (Tiago Forte, Building a Second Brain)\n\n## **Express:** Show your work.\n\n\"The final stage of the creative process, Express, is about refusing to wait until you have everything perfectly ready before you share what you know.\" (Tiago Forte, Building a Second Brain)\n\n### Intermediate Packets\n\nTiago recommends creating \"Intermediate Packets.\" which are small atomic units that makeup everything you can do. The idea is to reuse the packets in future work.\n\n- Distilled Notes\n- Outtakes\n- Work in Progress\n- Final Deliverables\n- Documents created by others.\n\n### Retrieve the knowledge in your Second Brain.\n\n1. Search\n2. Browser\n3. Tags\n4. Serendipity\n",

				"content_text": "<p>Finished reading: <a href=\"https://micro.blog/books/ISBN139798986862613\">Antinet Zettelkasten</a> by Scott P. Scheper, 📚 a book about how to create an analog Zettelkasten (slip box) that acts as a “communication partner” for thinking and creating.</p>\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.micro.blog/photos/300x/https://ericgregorich.com/uploads/2022/282d352fe5.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"\" height=\"\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>After seeing a couple of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnvMBVMXMPKA4Lmy5Ihd-FQ\">videos</a> from Scott and keeping up with his <a href=\"https://scottscheper.com/\">website</a>, I expected this book to be a deep and dull venture into the analog Zettelkasten, including tons of history and facts. Not that his other content is this way, but the build-up to the book made me think this. However, I thought it flowed nicely and was pretty easy to read. Perhaps this is because I’m already familiar with the material, so I didn’t get stuck at any point. Also, the book appears much longer than it is. Each chapter has several pages of footnotes, and I recommend exploring them, but they take up a lot of space.</p>\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"Antinet Zettelkasten-4.png\" src=\"https://ericgregorich.com/uploads/2022/8c2e145a24.png\" alt=\"Antinet Zettelkasten 4\" width=\"779\" height=\"438\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>Scott explores the analog Zettelkasten, made famous by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niklas_Luhmann\">Niklas Luhmann</a>, a German sociologist, philosopher of social scient, and a prominent thinker in systems theory. Luhmann used a note card system that enabled him to publish dozens of books and hundreds of scholarly articles over his lifetime. The Antinet is Scott’s version of this system, nearly identical to the original.</p>\n<p>The four principles of the Antinet are Analog, Numeric-Alpha, Tree, and Index. The Net in Antinet stands for network. I won’t try to go into the details in this post; there are plenty of other <a href=\"https://zettelkasten.de/posts/introduction-antinet-zettelkasten/\">articles</a> that do this well (or get the <a href=\"https://micro.blog/books/ISBN139798986862613\">book</a>).</p>\n<p>While Scott has an <a href=\"https://scottscheper.com/letter/1/\">article</a> on his website explaining how to get started with an Antinet, the book goes into much more detail. You’ll learn how to create the cards, bib notes, index, and other system components. It does take a while to get to the step-by-step instructions, but it’s probably important to understand the concepts first.</p>\n<p>Scott spends a reasonable amount of time discussing how this analog system can become your “communication partner.” This idea is pulled from Luhmann’s essay “<a href=\"http://luhmann.surge.sh/communicating-with-slip-boxes\">Communicating with Slip Boxes</a>.” If you want to go deeper into Luhmann’s work, you can visit the <a href=\"https://niklas-luhmann-archiv.de/\">Niklas Luhmann Archive</a>.</p>\n<p>Scott mentions (several times) <a href=\"https://www.soenkeahrens.de/en/takesmartnotes\">How to Take Smart Notes</a> by Sönke Ahrens and how, although Sönke introduced the Zettelkasten system to modern day, he also gets much of it wrong, especially by trying to make it work in digital tools.</p>\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"Antinet Zettelkasten-2.png\" src=\"https://ericgregorich.com/uploads/2022/f15c61122a.png\" alt=\"Antinet Zettelkasten 2\" width=\"779\" height=\"438\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Who should create an Antinet?</strong> This system is not for those who need to capture technical notes, meeting notes, etc. This is a thinking tool, and you would use it to gather your thoughts during research. The system is best suited for specific projects where you need to do a lot of research, gather your thoughts, and then create an output (academic paper, article, book, etc.).</p>\n<p>You want to use an analog Zettelkasten because it forces you to slow down and think. Not only do you have to take the time to write notes by hand on index cards, but you also have to think about where to put the card. This is intentional, forcing you to think and connect ideas by flipping through your cards. As you do this, you engrain these thoughts into memory.</p>\n<p><strong>Am I going to create my Antinet?</strong> Maybe someday, but I don’t need it now. As I mentioned earlier, it is best to have a big project or do a lot of research. I’ll be honest. When I first read How to Take Smart Notes by Sönke Ahrens, I tried to create a digital Zettelkasten. I spent about a year of my life trying different tools and approaches. I later realized I was pursuing the system for the wrong reasons. I was trying to force a square peg into a round hole. Not only that, I was trying to replicate it in Digital tools, which misses the point.</p>\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"Antinet Zettelkasten.png\" src=\"https://ericgregorich.com/uploads/2022/ca15ff2154.png\" alt=\"Antinet Zettelkasten\" width=\"779\" height=\"438\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>Overall, this was a good book. I would recommend you check out Scott’s <a href=\"https://scottscheper.com\">website</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnvMBVMXMPKA4Lmy5Ihd-FQ\">videos</a> first. If these are interesting, then the book is for you. I enjoyed it more than I expected, but I admit, I geek out on this stuff.</p>\n",

You can also email tasks into your account.</p>\n<p>Otherwise, TuexDuex is a very minimal app, almost like writing on a big sheet of paper.</p>\n<p>One downside of TuexDuex is that it doesn’t work as an actual calendar, so there is no way to plan my work in a calendar view to see what I have time to work on. On the other hand, I don’t need to estimate my tasks and reschedule things all the time. With TeuxDeux, I see the current week and schedule the tasks I plan to work on during the day after reviewing my calendar. It’s more of a “finger in the wind” approach.</p>\n<p>Here is a screenshot with most of my tasks blurred out for obvious reasons.

It was <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cjgbest/status/1602370307884318720\">quickly corrected</a> by Substack Co-founder/CEO Chris Best.</p>\n<p>Substack is not “powered” by Ghost. Instead, a specific site using Substack was built using Substacks theming API, which is compatible with themes built for Ghost. This means the developer who implemented the Substack theme basically ported the Ghost theme for Substack. All of this was done legally using best practices (according to Chris Best).</p>\n<p>What I find funny is all of the responses to the original post, even those posted after the corrections were stated in the same thread. People are congratulating Ghost and have completely made the assumption that <a href=\"https://substack.com\">Substack</a> is now Powered by <a href=\"https://ghost.org/\">Ghost</a>, which is not true at all.</p>\n<p>If you see such a claim by an individual on Twitter, of all places, do you not question its legitimacy?

The main idea (as I understand it) is that when you build a complex system of notes, they appear unfinished and confusing when others view them, but to you, they’re useful and full of insight. It is the time and effort that makes the system useful and increases your understanding. When you move your Zettelkasten from one tool to another or analog to digital, you’re potentially replacing the core piece of what made it special.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We are now entering the paradox of the Ship of Theseus. Imagine a ship leaving the harbour with a certain set of parts. During the journey, parts break down and are replaced by new ones. When the ship returns home, all parts are replaced by new ones. Is the ship still the same? And if not: at which moment does the ship become another one? <a id=\"fnref:1\" class=\"footnote\" title=\"see footnote\" href=\"#fn:1\">[1]</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<div class=\"footnotes\"><hr />\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn:1\">\n<p><a href=\"https://zettelkasten.de/posts/ghost-in-the-box/\">Philosophy of Zettelkasten: What is the Ghost in the Box?</a> <a class=\"reversefootnote\" title=\"return to article\" href=\"#fnref:1\"> ↩</a></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n",

				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>When it comes to my note-taking app, I have a few criteria.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Can I write in it? I’m talking about simple, distraction-free writing. Markdown support is necessary to write and add some basic formatting without leaving the keyboard.</li>\n<li>Can I get my notes out of it? I don’t want to use any application where I’ll struggle to move my notes elsewhere.</li>\n<li>Is it available everywhere? As a user of Windows, Mac, and iOS, I need an app that will work everywhere.</li>\n<li>Is it flexible? Can I organize my notes by folders or tags? I don’t organize much and rely on search to find what I need. Some simple tags and a couple of folders suit my workflow.</li>\n<li>Can I easily publish my notes elsewhere? Sometimes it’s my blog. Sometimes it is to a PDF or some other application.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If I were only using a Mac, I’d probably use Bear for my notes. I love its clean and simple interface, speed, and export capabilities. But I’m also using Windows, so I’ve been searching for an app that will meet my requirements.</p>\n<p>I have been using Evernote for years, and it checks some of the boxes. The biggest downside to Evernote is the note editor is not as clean as I would like, and getting notes out of Evernote can be a pain Although many apps import from Evernote, it’s not a great experience.</p>\n<p>Then I discovered <a title=\"UpNote\" href=\"https://getupnote.com\">UpNote</a>, a notes app similar to Bear. UpNote supports markdown and has a focus mode, making it a pleasure to write in. The sync is fast and reliable. It has plenty of features. I can organize by folder and tags. And it’s available on macOS, Windows, iOS, Android, and even Linux. I can export to various formats, including Markdown or PDF.</p>\n<p>What is UpNote missing? Well, on paper, it’s not missing much. In reality, a few things would make it perfect (for me). One is the ability to drag and drop notes into folders. Not a big deal. Since folders can be organized in any order, you can create sub-folders and even add colors and images to folder thumbnails, I’ll let it slide. Maybe some more explore options and better Markdown export. When I copy Markdown into other apps, sometimes I have to fix some things.</p>\n<p>There is also something else that is missing that I can’t quite put my finger on. You may get some level of polish from apps like Bear or Ulysses. UpNote is a beautiful app, but if I were to compare the UI, Bear might be a 9 or 10, while UpNote is an 8 or 9. UpNote’s UI is beautiful but safe and not as exciting to use as other premium apps.</p>\n<p>I will stick with UpNote for a while and see if it meets my needs long-term. Let me know if you use the app yourself or know of any similar apps!</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>Evernote <a title=\"announced\" href=\"https://evernote.com/blog/evernote-next-move-joining-bending-spoons/\">announced</a> Bending Spoons, a developer of mobile apps had acquired them. Bending Spoons is known for (or not known for) its mobile apps, including, Splice, Remini, and 30 Day Fitness.</p>\n<p>Like many, my first thoughts were, “this doesn’t make sense. Evernote is doomed!”. However, Bending Spoons must have the funds and technology to take Evernote to the next level. In a way, this is kind of exciting. Let’s hope they don’t blow it.</p>\n<p>What does this purchase mean for Evernote? It’s hard to say without knowing more about Bending Spoons. Looking through their website, it appears they’re heavily invested in AI (who isn’t these days). Adding some AI to Evernote could be pretty exciting. Evernote is already great (if not the best) at capturing and storing information. Adding AI to help connect notes, write text, update media, etc., could be a welcome addition. It’s also possible Bending Spoons does absolutely nothing with Evernote, and it’s business as usual.</p>\n<p>I’ve been an Evernote user for over a decade and have accumulated nearly 7 thousand notes. Like many, Evernote has become a dumping ground where everything gets added to a massive black hole, never to be seen again. Don’t get me wrong, Evernote search is excellent, and with OCR, notebooks, and tags, users who like to use Evernote for their daily workflow have many options.</p>\n<p>I keep jumping into the Evernote app to see what’s new and occasionally to grab an old note. I just haven’t been able to stick with it lately because of the bloat. There are many other simple and sleeker tools out there today.</p>\n<p>I must admit that Evernote has come a long way in the past year or two after its massive rewrite. The app is pretty fast and responsive on all platforms. If it had better export and the ability to hide the features I don’t want to use, it would be tempting to use it full-time again. At this point, I’ll wait to see how this acquisition turns out before jumping back in.</p>\n",

				"title": "4 things I love about Feedbin",
				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>I use a feed reader to pull in all the articles I’m interested in (using RSS), YouTube channels I subscribe to, social network lists, and even email newsletters. This allows me to avoid endless feeds, algorithms, and unwanted ads. When I read something, it is marked as read, and I don’t need to see it again.</p>\n<p>I’ve tried several feed readers over the years since Google Reader was killed. The list includes Feedly, Inoreader, NetNewsWire, News Explorer, Reader, and others. Some of them have great features that I like. I especially liked the ability to take highlights and notes in Feedly pro, and they would sync automatically into my Readwise account.</p>\n<p>However, the feed reader I’ve stuck with the longest is <a title=\"Feedbin\" href=\"http://feedbin.com\">Feedbin</a>. Why? I think there are a few reasons.</p>\n<h2 id=\"1feedbinissimple\">1) Feedbin is Simple</h2>\n<p>Feedbin doesn’t try to do too much. It has a simple and clean UI. You can use other Feed Readers with Feedbin, like <a title=\"Reeder\" href=\"https://reederapp.com\">Reeder</a>, <a title=\"Unread\" href=\"https://www.goldenhillsoftware.com/unread/\">Unread</a>, and many <a href=\"https://feedbin.com/apps\">others</a>. I find the Feedbin iOS apps are great and get the job done.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2feedbinsupportsnewsletters\">2) Feedbin supports newsletters</h2>\n<p>As I said, I now send all of my newsletters directly to Feedbin. This helps keep my email clean. I like the way Feedbin handles email newsletters. Rather than parsing the text, like it would most web articles, it gives me the option to show the newsletter in its original format, which I find better.</p>\n<p>Here is an example newsletter from <a title=\"NessLabs\" href=\"https://nesslabs.com\">Ness Labs</a>.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"uploads/2022/9d094e3c73.png\" alt=\"Example Ness Labs newsletter shown in Feedbin\" />\n<figcaption>Example Ness Labs newsletter shown in Feedbin</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h2 id=\"3feedbinhandlestweetsandmicro.blogpostswell\">3) Feedbin handles Tweets and Micro.blog posts well</h2>\n<p>Feedbin lets you subscribe to Twitter users and lists, which is excellent in itself, but I love that I can click the little chat icon and see the entire thread directly in Feedbin.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"uploads/2022/c48a1967bc.png\" alt=\"Example Tweet Thread in Feedbin\" />\n<figcaption>Example Tweet Thread in Feedbin</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>This also works with Micro.blog. If you add the <a title=\"Discover Feed\" href=\"https://micro.blog/discover\">Discover feed</a> or follow individual users, you click on the small Micro.blog icon to see the entire thread without leaving Feedbin.</p>\n<p>You still need to leave Feedbin and open the original post to reply. :(</p>\n<h2 id=\"4feedbinletsmesharedirectlytomicro.blogandothers\">4) Feedbin lets me share directly to Micro.blog and others</h2>\n<p>If I see something interesting while reading in Feedbin, I can easily share using the native Share Sheet or even share the link and my comments directly to my blog.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"uploads/2022/dc9a2b475a.png\" alt=\"Example share with Micro.blog from Feedbin\" />\n<figcaption>Example share with Micro.blog from Feedbin</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p><a title=\"Feedbin\" href=\"http://feedbin.com\">Feedbin</a> is not perfect. It costs $50 per year (which I gladly pay), and it doesn’t have a native Mac app.</p>\n",

Instead, it is about how this “Attention Crisis” impacts society.</p>\n<p>Here are some of my notes about the author’s points in this book.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatimpactisthisattentioncrisishavingonourlives\">What impact is this Attention Crisis having on our lives?</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>We’re finding it harder to find “Flow,” during which we become engrossed in an activity without disruptions.</li>\n<li>With all the tiny bits of information continuously flowing into our lives, it becomes less likely that we’ll read books.</li>\n<li>It’s harder to think because we don’t allow our minds to wonder as much as we should. Mind wandering is a critical stage in which our brain has insights, makes connections, and plans for the future.</li>\n<li>Technology is becoming better at keeping us distracted. The more we look at their service, the more money the company makes, so they manipulate us to keep us engaged.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"whatiscontributingtothisattentioncrisis\">What is contributing to this Attention Crisis?</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>We’re bombarded with chemicals that harm our health and, ultimately, our attention.</li>\n<li>Failing to explore ADHD. More people than ever are diagnosed with ADHD, yet we’ve prescribed medications rather than solving the causes.</li>\n<li>Our children are not allowed to explore and play like in the past. They’re no longer playing in the streets and wandering the neighborhood. They’re told precisely what to do in school and what the outcome should be rather than allowing creative learning.</li>\n<li>We’re not getting enough sleep due to artificial light and consumer capitalism. We’re spending too much time flipping through Tick-Tock videos rather than going to bed at a decent time and allowing our brains to recover and make connections during sleep.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"howdowerecover\">How do we recover?</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Fewer work hours to allow us more time to rest and recover.</li>\n<li>Allow our children more time to play and explore, especially at school.</li>\n<li>Change our technology to be less disruptive to our lives. Yet, the companies building it do not have an incentive to do so unless regulations are established, which is an entirely different issue.</li>\n<li>Take it upon ourselves to control what we consume, get more sleep and exercise, and spend quality time reading and just being bored. It’s good for us!</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a title=\"Stolen Focus\" href=\"https://amzn.to/3Uaacpe\">Get Stolen Focus on Amazon</a>.</p>\n",

Yet, the author explains, it’s part of how we learn and create.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Creativity is not where you create some new thing that’s emerged from your brain.” “It’s a new association between two things already there.” Mind-wandering allows “more extended trains of thought to unfold, which allows for more associations to be made.” - Stolen Focus p96</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>While this is nothing new, it caught my attention because I daydream. Ever since I was a kid, I would get in trouble for not paying attention. I suppose my excuse now is, “I’m creating something!”.</p>\n<p>Mind wandering is a necessary part of how our brains work. For example, as we read, we focus on the words. Our mind tries to make connections to the ideas we’re reading about. We may think of past experiences, related reading, or even contradictions. This is precisely what we should be doing. This part of reading helps us learn and make sense of things.</p>\n<p>Of course, we can easily take our minds wandering too far when we’re trying to read but keep thinking about checking Twitter or what’s for dinner. In these cases, we’re getting into distraction territory.</p>\n",

This gives me all the context I need for that task or project.

Can’t we add a checkbox to allow the admin to select which records they want to include in the report? Yes! Well, that makes things much easier!</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>Finished reading: <a href=\"https://micro.blog/books/9780593135228\">Project Hail Mary: A Novel</a> by Andy Weir 📚.</p>\n<p>Project Hail Mary is a story by the same author of The Martian, Andy Weir. While The Martian’s story is grounded in the science we understand today, Project Hail Mary goes beyond that and adds more sci-fi without breaking the rules of science.</p>\n<p>The other difference between The Martian and Project Hail Mary is the scope. In The Martian, Mark Watney is stranded on Mars and needs to figure out how to get home. In Project Hail Mary, the Sun is being destroyed by a phenomenon, and Ryland Grace must travel to a distant star to figure out how to save Earth.</p>\n<p>The protagonist, Ryland Grace, is a science teacher who ends up as the sole survivor of the Hail Mary as it travels to its destination, where we hope to figure out how to save Earth. Ryland wakes from a coma with no memory of how he got there or even who he is. Fortunately, his memory comes back over time.</p>\n<p>As Ryland solves one problem after another aboard the Hail Mary, his memories slowly return. We see the planning of the Project Hail Mary mission on Earth and how Ryland was “chosen” for the mission. We also see the sacrifices that are made to make the mission happen.</p>\n<p>The writing is engaging and fun. While much math is involved, you can get the point without understanding it. It all makes sense. This is one of the special things about Andy Weir’s writing style. You can tell he loves this stuff. He spent a lot of time researching and discussing “what if” scenarios with real scientists and astronauts. After the success of The Martian, he likely has a pool of resources available to him.</p>\n<p>This story is not your typical sci-fi. I felt like this could happen. Ryland’s problems were science-based and felt realistic instead of forced plot twists to make the story exciting. Many times in this book, I imagined all of the things that could have been done if this were an action sci-fi story that we would typically see. Instead, we get a great story about a guy working out extraordinary problems.</p>\n<p>I enjoyed this book.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Working the problem” - NASA</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>By the way, a Project Hail Mary movie is being made, starring Ryan Gosling.</p>\n",

				"title": "The true purpose of a Zettelkasten",
				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>A Zettelkasten is a German word that translates to “slip box.” The term became used to describe a particular workflow that Niklas Luhmann used to publish about 50 books and 550 articles over his career.</p>\n<p>Many great articles are out there describing Niklas Luhmann’s Zettelkasten system. As well as a few books, so I won’t go into those details here. Instead, I want to focus on the key concepts I realized about a Zettelkasten over time.</p>\n<p>A Zettelkasten is a box of notes. Luhmann’s workflow to take and organize notes became synonymous with Zettelkasten. When we hear the word Zettelkasten today, we think of the workflow process, not necessarily a box of index cards.</p>\n<p>Sönke Ahrens helped make the Zettelkasten popular with his book How To Take Smart Notes. Sönke introduced the names of the various types of notes, Fleeting, Literature, Permanent, and Project, to describe the various phases of Luhmann’s workflow. However, these names were never part of Luhmann’s vocabulary to describe his system (in fact, Luhmann rarely talked about his workflow).</p>\n<p>Digital tools try to mimic the Zettelkasten workflow that Luhmann used. However, digital tools have many advantages that make some parts of his analog workflow seem wasteful, such as numbering and limiting space to what fits on a 4x6 card. We can now easily connect notes using Wiki Links, see connections using Backlinks, see a graph of notes related to the current note, and even see a visual of the entire system to identify clusters of information. Not to mention full-text search and hyperlinks!</p>\n<p>While we can take advantage of these digital tools, we need to remember the fundamental purpose of the Zettelkasten. It’s not to make as many notes and connections as we can to grow an enormous graph that will somehow start answering all of our questions and do the writing for us.</p>\n<div class=\"kg-card kg-callout-card kg-callout-card-blue\">\n<div class=\"kg-callout-text\">Luhmann’s Zettelkasten system worked because it forced him to slow down and think about each idea and how it relates to the other ideas. Numbering each card to connect it to another card was a painstaking process, which required him to spend more time organizing his notes than actually writing his publications. This gave him the time (in his head) to make real connections and insights. Digital tools can easily abstract this from us if we’re not careful.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"kg-card kg-callout-card kg-callout-card-green\">\n<div class=\"kg-callout-text\">Another reason Luhmann created so much content is that throughout his process, he spent time creating output that would be used in his work. Rather than capturing and making quick notes, he spent the time writing out his interpretation in his own words. When writing his publications, his thinking was already done, and he could focus on creating a draft.</div>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"quotes\">Quotes</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Of course, I do not think of all this on my own; it mostly happens in my file. … In essence, the filing system explains my productivity. … Filing takes more of my time than writing the books” - Niklas Luhmann</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“What Luhmann appeared to have done instead was to immediately write his own thoughts on whatever he read in a way that would be as close to being publishable as possible. That’s what allowed him to be so productive, he was constantly creating output, rather than accumulating knowledge in a way that may lead to future output, which is what most of us do when taking notes.” (level 1, Zettelkasten is NOT a note-taking system(?))</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Write all your notes and quotes on separate three-by-five-inch cards. Then, when you get ready to organize your thinking, just spread them all out on the floor, see the natural structure that emerges, and figure out what’s missing.” (David Allen, Getting Things Done)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"additional-reading\">Additional Reading</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://luhmann.surge.sh/communicating-with-slip-boxes\">Communicating with Slip Boxes by Niklas Luhmann</a> - An article by Niklas Luhmann explains how his file system became a communication partner.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/88f8/fa9dfbc0c2b296758dd932b871917c5c775a.pdf?_ga=2.255211660.501069040.1661645834-1988662615.1661645834\">Niklas Luhmann’s Card Index by Johannes Schmidt</a> - A chapter describing Niklas Luhmann’s card index in detail.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3dRuuDW\">How to Take Smart Notes by Sönke Ahrens</a> - The book that popularized the Zettelkasten system.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://scottscheper.com/letter/1/\">How to Get Started Building and Antinet Zettelkasten</a> - If you’re interested in an analog Zettelkasten, Scott Scheper may describe it best.

You can also create Groups to help organize your collections.</p>\n<p>I have been using the <a href=\"https://fortelabs.co/blog/para/\">PARA</a> method to provide a straightforward way to organize content. I like to keep it simple.</p>\n<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img class=\"kg-image\" src=\"https://ericgregorich.com/uploads/2022/9e177e74a6.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></figure>\n<ul>\n<li>Unsorted: Things I want to read or watch later. They’ll often be deleted unless they’re worth keeping, then I’ll send them to another collection and add some tags.</li>\n<li>Shared: I have a shared collection of Microsoft and <a href=\"https://raindrop.io/egregorich/focustivity-resources-26717462/search\">Focustivity bookmarks</a>.</li>\n<li>Projects: I create a collection for each project where I gather links and web content. I don’t usually have many projects of this type.</li>\n<li>Areas: A collection for each area of my life. I’ll store manuals, links to important sites, and other things here.</li>\n<li>Resources: This is where most of my bookmarks go. I have a single Resources collection that I dump everything into. I add a couple of tags to make it easier to filter later.</li>\n<li>Archive: Where I keep archived projects.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"highlights\">Highlights</h2>\n<p>One of my favorite features in Raindrop is the Highlights. Once installed with the browser extension, you can highlight text on a page and save the highlight directly to Raindrop. You can also use this feature now in Raindrop (like the image below). Select a webpage, highlight some text, and add annotations if you want.</p>\n<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img class=\"kg-image\" src=\"https://ericgregorich.com/uploads/2022/2295115915.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></figure>\n<p>These highlights can <a href=\"https://readwise.io/raindrop_syncing\">sync to Readwise</a> (this feature was not announced at the time of this post).</p>\n<h2 id=\"search\">Search</h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://help.raindrop.io/using-search/\">search</a> functionality is pretty solid, featuring Full-Text search meaning it will find content within your bookmarks and PDFs.

I think most people can get by with the free version, which includes unlimited bookmarks, collections, highlights, and most features.</p>\n<p>The pro version provides extra features like full-text search, nested collections, annotations, duplicate link finder, automatic backups, 10Gb files per month, and priority email support.</p>\n<h2 id=\"who-is-raindrop-for\">Who is Raindrop for?</h2>\n<p>Raindrop is not going to be a replacement for an academic research tool like Zotero, where you will need citations, PDF annotations, and integrations to note applications like Obsidian.</p>\n<p>For anyone who wants to save bookmarks, and does some light highlighting and annotations, then Raindrop is a great option.</p>\n",

All the app does is give you seven screens to write text.</p>\n<p>Are you blown away yet?</p>\n<p>Yeah, it sounds pretty simple. Then when you mention the $19.99 price tag, you will laugh.</p>\n<p>What this app does is extremely simple, yet it fits a need that I’ve been looking for. I wanted a standalone app that gives me a page of text I can write on throughout the day. I keep notes, tasks, links, clipboard text, and all kinds of things on this page. This page syncs across devices, including my phone, so I can quickly update it throughout the day.</p>\n<p>Using a “Working Memory” text file on your computer is nothing new. In his podcast, Cal Newport talks about it and has an <a href=\"https://www.calnewport.com/blog/2015/10/27/deep-habits-workingmemory-txt-the-most-important-productivity-tool-youve-never-heard-of/\">article</a> explaining his method.</p>\n<p>When using only Microsoft Windows, I would use Notepad all the time for this. Now that I’m on Mac, I tried using an Apple Note or a simple document that syncs across devices. I think the biggest problem I had with them is there were too many options. I did more formatting and playing around with the note than just using it.</p>\n<p>I only just started using Tot Pocket. So far, I like it. The sync is fast and reliable and has just enough features to allow me to jot down notes and tasks throughout the day without being distracted.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>I recently switched my setup to a Mac. As a long-time Windows user, this is quite a jarring transition. There were some things I immediately missed from Windows and some things that I had to spend some time figuring out because they make no sense on a Mac.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Poor window management.</li>\n<li>Closing an app doesn’t quit it.</li>\n<li>Every app seems to have a menu icon that clutters the top menu.</li>\n<li>Lacking alt-tab to switch windows.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I will share some critical apps and tips I learned while setting up my Mac mini to be a lean, productive machine.</p>\n<h2 id=\"keyboard-shortcuts\">Keyboard Shortcuts</h2>\n<p>Since I’m already moving to a Mac, I may as well get better at using keyboard shortcuts and use the mouse less.</p>\n<p>Learning keyboard shortcuts is one of the best things you can do for productivity. It takes so much time to reach for the mouse and move it to click on something.</p>\n<p>Keyboard shortcuts allow you quickly search and execute tasks without removing your fingers from the keyboard.</p>\n<p>Learning these keyboard shortcuts can be daunting, and I still struggle with them, especially with various applications using different shortcuts for different purposes.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Keep the <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201236\" rel=\"noopener ugc nofollow\">Mac keyboard shortcuts — Apple Support</a> documentation handy.</li>\n<li>Look for the Keyboard Shortcuts for your favorite apps.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"some-critical-keyboard-shortcuts-on-mac\">Some critical keyboard shortcuts on Mac</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>CTRL-CMD-Q: Lock the desktop.</li>\n<li>SHIFT-CMD-Q: Log out.</li>\n<li>CMD-SPACE: To search for anything.</li>\n<li>CMD-X: Cut the selected item to the clipboard.</li>\n<li>CMD-C: Copy the selected item to the clipboard.</li>\n<li>CMD-V: Paste the selected item from the clipboard.</li>\n<li>CMD-W: Close the current window</li>\n<li>CMD-Q: Quit the existing app</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"essential-utilities\">Essential Utilities</h2>\n<p>Several utilities help make the Mac faster and easier to get things done. Here are a few that I’ve discovered so far.</p>\n<h3 id=\"setapp\">SetApp</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://go.setapp.com/invite/bl2jnwf8\" rel=\"noopener ugc nofollow\">Setapp</a> is a service that consolidates hundreds of Mac and iOS apps into one subscription. Setapp can save you a ton of money, depending on your apps, and it’s worth checking SetApp before purchasing any apps on the Mac. Like I did, you may find it cheaper to get a SetApp subscription that includes the apps you want and hundreds of other apps and utilities.</p>\n<h3 id=\"raycast\">Raycast</h3>\n<p>Mac OS has a built-in Spotlight search that triggers when you click CMD-Space. If you find Spotlight lacking, check out <a href=\"https://www.raycast.com/\" rel=\"noopener ugc nofollow\">Raycast</a>.</p>\n<p>Raycast is a fast and extendable application launcher that does so much more. You can search anything, open anything, manage windows, and perform various other tasks that I have yet to explore.</p>\n<p>Be sure to take the time to go through the provided walk-through. Once you realize the power of Raycast, the sky is the limit.</p>\n<p>Alternatives include Alfred.</p>\n<h3 id=\"1password\">1Password</h3>\n<p>When setting up any OS, I first install 1Password, where all my passwords and other information are securely stored.</p>\n<p>You could get by with Apple’s Keychain if you only use the Apple ecosystem. Other alternatives include LastPass and Dashlane.</p>\n<h3 id=\"bartender\">Bartender</h3>\n<p>Nearly every app you install on your Mac creates a menu icon in the top-right that gives you quick access to some of the functionality. Eventually, you’ll end up with a menu bar that spans the width of your monitor, which is distracting.</p>\n<p>Bartender allows you to configure this menu, only showing the icons you want to see and hiding the rest under a menu.</p>\n<h3 id=\"cleanmymac-x\">CleanMyMac X</h3>\n<p>I’m constantly installing and uninstalling applications, testing to see what they do and if they help me. Unfortunately, this leaves clutter on the MAC, including files and folders and other settings that get left behind even when you uninstall.</p>\n<p>CleanMyMac helps remove all of this unnecessary clutter from your Mac.</p>\n<h3 id=\"bettersnaptool\">BetterSnapTool</h3>\n<p>I have a widescreen monitor, and the biggest thing I missed from Windows is the ability to snap my windows to various positions on the screen.</p>\n<p>BetterSnapTool does this on the Mac. You can easily position your apps and create custom areas for them to snap. Very handy!</p>\n<p>Some alternatives are Mosaic and Magnet. I’ve begun using Raycast to manage my windows using keyboard shortcuts, which I’m enjoying.</p>\n<h3 id=\"cleanshot-x\">CleanShot X</h3>\n<p>CleanShot X provides some excellent screen-capture capabilities. Quickly take screenshots, annotate them, then share them.</p>\n<h2 id=\"great-apps-exclusive-to-the-apple-ecosystem\">Great apps, exclusive to the Apple Ecosystem</h2>\n<p>One of the biggest reasons I switched to a Mac for my setup is the great apps. It feels like apps on Windows are an afterthought and are usually only ported web applications anyway.</p>\n<h3 id=\"things-3\">Things 3</h3>\n<p>Things 3 is probably one of the most elegant task management applications.</p>\n<h3 id=\"bear\">Bear</h3>\n<p>My favorite writing and note-taking application, Bear, is a straightforward markdown-based app that lets you focus on writing. You can organize your notes using tags.</p>\n<h3 id=\"craft\">Craft</h3>\n<p>Craft may arguably be the best all-purpose note-taking and documentation creation app. It is simple to use and has a beautiful design, and I use it to organize my life.</p>\n<h3 id=\"fantastical\">Fantastical</h3>\n<p>Fantastical is an excellent calendar app that goes beyond the out-of-the-box Apple calendar. Its most prominent feature may be the autocomplete functionality, and you can type an event or task in natural language, which will set all the details for you!</p>\n<p>I’ve only been using the Mac for a few weeks. I hope what I shared is useful. What are your favorite apps and tricks for the Mac? I’d love to learn more.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<p>I have recently discovered that I love writing on paper. It allows me to escape the digital world, and writing on paper allows me to think without distractions.</p>\n<p>But paper can be messy. You deal with flipping through pages, smudging, mistakes that are difficult to fix, inability to move things, etc. While some argue this adds to the experience, there could be a better solution for some.</p>\n<p>The reMarkable 2 is an e-ink device, similar to a Kindle, but built for writing. The reMarkable tries to feel like paper and provide a distraction-free writing environment while getting digital advantages.</p>\n<p>You may love using the reMarkable 2 if:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You enjoy writing on paper.</li>\n<li>You want a distraction-free place to write.</li>\n<li>You want to keep your notes backed up automatically.</li>\n<li>You want to share your notes easily.</li>\n<li>You don’t want to keep buying paper planners or notebooks.</li>\n<li>You like the idea of unlimited pages.</li>\n<li>You want to be able to search for notes quickly.</li>\n<li>You want to be able to fix mistakes, move things around, and easily make updates.</li>\n<li>You also want to read and annotate.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This article is my in-depth device review, including the hardware and software. It includes what I like and what I don’t like. I hope it will help you if you decide to purchase a reMarkable 2 for yourself.</p>\n<h2 id=\"first-impressions-of-the-hardware\">First Impressions of the Hardware</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://ericgregorich.com/uploads/2023/bd94f9fd72.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>The hardware is stunning. It is thin and light, and the all-aluminum body gives it a nice solid feel. It is like holding a slate; a solid strip on the left gives it a nice look.</p>\n<p>The material is the same on both sides. The back has four rubber nubs to keep the device from sliding around on a solid surface. The right side of the device has a magnet so you can attach the Marker.</p>\n<p>The battery life seems excellent. I have not had the device long enough to say exactly how long it will last. So far, I’ve had the tablet for six days and only charged it once, and it was at about 70% charge when I received it. reMarkable says “weeks of battery,” but that depends on how much you use the device. I probably have it turned on for several hours per day.</p>\n<p>It’s hard to complain about anything on the hardware itself. If anything, the screen margins are pretty thick, especially at the bottom. It’s hard to notice until you are writing and start to run out of space on the page.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Tip: You’ll need an external light source to see the screen. Don’t expect to read in the dark!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The other thing to note is that this device has no backlight. No backlight means you need an external light source to be able to see the screen.</p>\n<h3 id=\"technical-specifications\">Technical Specifications</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://ericgregorich.com/uploads/2023/ee786b3659.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<h3 id=\"remarkable-marker\">reMarkable Marker</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://ericgregorich.com/uploads/2023/181cdbb1b2.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>You can get either the regular Marker or the Marker plus. The Marker is white and has no buttons or eraser, and I have not used one, so people say it feels nice and has a nice texture based on my research.</p>\n<p>The Marker Plus is what I have, and the primary differences are that 1) It’s black, and 2) it comes with an eraser. The texture is excellent, and it has a nice weight to it. One side is flat, which serves two purposes, 1) to keep it from rolling off your desk, and 2. to attach to the device magnetically. I have had no problems writing with it. I also don’t feel it will easily detach from the device unless you toss it in a bag.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Is the extra $50 for the Marker Plus if it includes an eraser? I feel like it is. If you are like me and always messing up, it is simple to flip the Marker over and quickly erase it. It saves a lot of time.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Neither of the Markers needs to be charged.</p>\n<p>The biggest downside of the Marker is the tips. The tips are replaceable because they wear down. I have not had mine long enough to know how long they last. Based on my research, it could be every week to every six weeks. The reMarkable comes with nine extra tips and a way to replace them. The Marker Tips currently cost $14 for a replacement pack.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://ericgregorich.com/uploads/2023/37a92b375a.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Tip (pun intended): Don’t forget about the tips. It can be easy to miss them in the packaging. You’ll want to set them aside where you can find them again.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"the-book-folio\">The Book Folio</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://ericgregorich.com/uploads/2023/806a6748f9.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>I opted for the Gray Book Folio (Polymer Weave). It is very thin and covers the device nicely. Removing the reMarkable from the cover is effortless, yet it stays in place firmly.</p>\n<p>The material is acceptable — nothing to get excited over. It doesn’t feel like it is worth $99. But it’s cheaper than the $149 leather Book Folio (which I hear doesn’t feel like natural leather). It’s probably worth getting just because it helps protect your investment.</p>\n<h2 id=\"first-impressions-of-the-software\">First Impressions of the Software</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I was running version 2.5.0.27 when I wrote this since there have been drastic software improvements!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I had no problems figuring out how to use the software. It is very straightforward. Your main screen consists of your folders and files. Across the top are options to open the menu, create a folder, create a notebook, access Quick Sheets, or search. You can see the battery life, Wi-Fi connection, and sync status across the bottom of the main screen.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Tip: Talking about distraction-free, it doesn’t even have a clock!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I won’t go into details about the software interface; I think it works well and is pretty smooth. It would be best to remember that this is an e-ink device, and the page refresh differs from a typical tablet. I feel like the refresh is faster than my Kindle Paperwhite, and I have not had any issues with the performance.</p>\n<p>Sometimes the swipe event does not register, and I have to swipe multiple times to get it to swap between pages or close a notebook. It is not an issue if you swipe in the right place and with enough motion.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Tip: You can close any notebook or PDF you are on by swiping down from the top of the screen. Much faster than trying to use the menu.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"layers\">Layers</h3>\n<p>You can create Layers on your page, allowing you to manipulate one layer without affecting the other. Make elaborate sketches and diagrams or add text over a custom background.</p>\n<h3 id=\"text\">Text</h3>\n<p>Another cool feature is the ability to convert your handwriting to text. This feature works as well as can be expected. Your writing must be clear enough for it to recognize the words. You can only convert one or more pages to text. Once the conversion is complete, you have no choice but to email it somewhere. You can’t save the converted text to the device.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Tip: You need to connect to Wi-Fi for text conversion.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"templates\">Templates</h3>\n<p>The device comes with many built-in templates that you can use. The built-in templates include everything from dots to standard notebook lines with margins.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://ericgregorich.com/uploads/2023/6372bedaba.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>I immediately found myself not finding the templates that I wanted to use. Fortunately, you can add your custom templates with a bit of know-how. For more information, you can look at some of the additional resources I have at the bottom of this article.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, you can also use a PDF for your Daily Planner notebook type. You can find them everywhere, and Etsy is an excellent place to start. I added some more resources to the bottom of this article.</p>\n<h3 id=\"sharing\">Sharing</h3>\n<p>You can share pages or entire notebooks or PDFs from the device. You’ll be prompted to enter an email address or select an email you already used. You can add a message, change the filename, and select an export format (PDF, PNG, or SVG). The feature works well enough.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Tip: You can always download the PDF on your desktop and do what you want with it from there.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"search\">Search</h3>\n<p>From the search icon, you can easily search for any notebook, PDF, or Epub on your device. You will also see the most recently updated files on your device, making it easy to switch back and forth.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Unfortunately, your notes and files’ content is not searched — only the file names and folders.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"cloud-sync\">Cloud Sync</h3>\n<p>While using the reMarkable Cloud Sync is not required, it is hard to avoid. The advantage of using Cloud Sync is that your content is automatically backed up to the cloud and available on your other devices.</p>\n<p>The Cloud Sync works okay and is not instantaneous (most of the time), but it gets the job done.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-read-on-remarkable-browser-extension\">The “Read on reMarkable” Browser Extension</h3>\n<p>There is a new Browser extension from the Remarkable team called &lt;a href=&ldquo;<a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/read-on-remarkable/bfhkfdnddlhfippjbflipboognpdpoeh%22\">https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/read-on-remarkable/bfhkfdnddlhfippjbflipboognpdpoeh&quot;</a>&gt;Read on reMarkable&lt;/a&gt;.“ This extension lets you send nearly any webpage to your device with a single click. You have two options. The default is to send the page to the device in Epub format. This method looks excellent but does not include the source or any images! So I switched my default to PDF. The page is converted to PDF with this setting and sent directly to your device. The PDF option includes images and more information about the article.</p>\n<p>How the content looks on the device is hit or miss. It depends on the source content. If the page is full of ads and poorly formatted, it will be low quality on the device. I’ve found that sites with a clean format look great on the device.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Tip: Use the PDF format to include images and the source for your articles.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"desktop-and-mobile\">Desktop and Mobile</h3>\n<p>Speaking of Cloud Sync, you can access your content from your desktop or mobile devices. The desktop and mobile software is nothing spectacular; it merely shows you your content, just as you would see on your device. You can then read, rearrange, or export your content as needed.</p>\n<h3 id=\"jagged-line-issue\">Jagged Line Issue</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Tip: This could be a deal-breaker for some. I don’t feel like it is an issue, as I don’t notice it unless I’m looking for it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https://ericgregorich.com/uploads/2023/1f4c513904.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Updated March 27, 2021: The reMarkable team released version 2.6, which addresses this issue.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The ”Jagged Line Issue“ is one of the annoying things I found about Remarkable 2. If you look very closely at the writing (zoom in if it helps), you can see the lines are not smooth and jagged, depending on how you write. You can see a very (extremely detailed) video that explains the issue here.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-writing-experience\">The Writing Experience</h2>\n<p>Okay, you want to know how this table feels when writing.</p>\n<p>It feels remarkable, like writing on paper!</p>\n<p>One of the things I enjoy when writing on paper is how distraction-free it is, and the ”feeling&rdquo; of writing helps me slow down and think. I get the same feeling while writing on the Remarkable. In addition to that, I can easily erase, move things around, convert to text, and search.</p>\n<p>My writing is better when using the reMarkable. I write very small on paper, while on the reMarkable, I have more space and write larger and, therefore, more legibly.</p>\n<p>The latency is about 21ms, which is the best in the market. There is very little noticeable lag when writing.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-reading-experience\">The Reading Experience</h2>\n<p>I have limited experience with the reading functionality on the device. But here is what I have discovered so far.</p>\n<h3 id=\"pdf\">PDF</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://ericgregorich.com/uploads/2023/30046a1879.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>In general, PDFs look great on the reMarkable 2. My only complaint is that the device is too small to read most PDFs comfortably. Articles converted to PDF work well.</p>\n<h3 id=\"epub\">EPUB</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://ericgregorich.com/uploads/2023/dfa930ab6a.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>I have heard that the reMarkable doesn’t work well with EPUB, and I don’t have enough experience with them yet to know for sure. I added one EPUB to the device, &lt;a href=&ldquo;<a href=\"https://gumroad.com/l/doing-content-right%22\">https://gumroad.com/l/doing-content-right&quot;</a>&gt;Doing Content Right, by Steph Smith&lt;/a&gt;. It looks great! I’ve had no problems, and it has been much easier to read than the PDF version.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Tip: You cannot read your Kindle books on this device.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"the-price\">The Price</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The reMarkable itself is $399.</li>\n<li>The Marker is $49. The Marker Plus is $99.</li>\n<li>The Folios start at $69 and go up to $149.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>My setup, the reMarkable with the Marker Plus and Book Folio, came to $597 before tax. Ouch!</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Tip: Yes, you see that correctly. The reMarkable writing device does not include a Marker, which is ridiculous!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"what-would-make-the-remarkable-2-better\">What would make the reMarkable 2 better?</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix the Jagged lines issue. (reMarkable fixed the Jagged Lines issue in version 2.6)</li>\n<li>Include the content, even your handwritten notes, in search results.</li>\n<li>Faster sync.</li>\n<li>More Text Conversion options.</li>\n<li>Provide better formatting for both PDF and EPUB.</li>\n<li>Better support. I have not needed to contact the reMarkable support team, but I have not heard great things regarding response times.</li>\n<li>Provide more support for accessing your content without using Cloud Sync.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It is worth purchasing a reMarkable 2 if you like to write and if you like to use paper for organizing your day. Taking meeting notes, writing thoughts, drafting articles, making sketches and diagrams, disconnecting from the world, and getting lost in your thoughts is excellent.</p>\n<p>While I love the reMarkable 2 and use it daily as part of my workflow, it is not a perfect device. The good news is that, in theory, software updates could resolve some of the existing problems.</p>\n<p>If you’re looking for a distraction-free digital writing device, I highly recommend it.</p>\n",

You can see the battery life, Wi-Fi connection, and sync status across the bottom of the main screen.\n\n> Tip: Talking about distraction-free, it doesn’t even have a clock!\n\nI won’t go into details about the software interface; I think it works well and is pretty smooth. It would be best to remember that this is an e-ink device, and the page refresh differs from a typical tablet. I feel like the refresh is faster than my Kindle Paperwhite, and I have not had any issues with the performance.\n\nSometimes the swipe event does not register, and I have to swipe multiple times to get it to swap between pages or close a notebook. It is not an issue if you swipe in the right place and with enough motion.\n\n> Tip: You can close any notebook or PDF you are on by swiping down from the top of the screen. Much faster than trying to use the menu.\n\n### Layers\nYou can create Layers on your page, allowing you to manipulate one layer without affecting the other. Make elaborate sketches and diagrams or add text over a custom background.\n\n### Text\nAnother cool feature is the ability to convert your handwriting to text. This feature works as well as can be expected. Your writing must be clear enough for it to recognize the words. You can only convert one or more pages to text. Once the conversion is complete, you have no choice but to email it somewhere. You can’t save the converted text to the device.\n\n> Tip: You need to connect to Wi-Fi for text conversion.\n\n### Templates\nThe device comes with many built-in templates that you can use. The built-in templates include everything from dots to standard notebook lines with margins.\n\n![](https://ericgregorich.com/uploads/2023/6372bedaba.png)\n\nI immediately found myself not finding the templates that I wanted to use. Fortunately, you can add your custom templates with a bit of know-how. For more information, you can look at some of the additional resources I have at the bottom of this article.\n\nFortunately, you can also use a PDF for your Daily Planner notebook type. You can find them everywhere, and Etsy is an excellent place to start. I added some more resources to the bottom of this article.\n\n### Sharing\nYou can share pages or entire notebooks or PDFs from the device. You’ll be prompted to enter an email address or select an email you already used. You can add a message, change the filename, and select an export format (PDF, PNG, or SVG). The feature works well enough.\n\n> Tip: You can always download the PDF on your desktop and do what you want with it from there.\n\n### Search\nFrom the search icon, you can easily search for any notebook, PDF, or Epub on your device. You will also see the most recently updated files on your device, making it easy to switch back and forth.\n\n> Unfortunately, your notes and files’ content is not searched — only the file names and folders.\n\n### Cloud Sync\nWhile using the reMarkable Cloud Sync is not required, it is hard to avoid. The advantage of using Cloud Sync is that your content is automatically backed up to the cloud and available on your other devices.\n\nThe Cloud Sync works okay and is not instantaneous (most of the time), but it gets the job done.\n\n### The “Read on reMarkable” Browser Extension\nThere is a new Browser extension from the Remarkable team called \\<a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/read-on-remarkable/bfhkfdnddlhfippjbflipboognpdpoeh\"\\>Read on reMarkable\\</a\\>.“ This extension lets you send nearly any webpage to your device with a single click. You have two options. The default is to send the page to the device in Epub format. This method looks excellent but does not include the source or any images! So I switched my default to PDF. The page is converted to PDF with this setting and sent directly to your device. The PDF option includes images and more information about the article.\n\nHow the content looks on the device is hit or miss. It depends on the source content. If the page is full of ads and poorly formatted, it will be low quality on the device. I’ve found that sites with a clean format look great on the device.\n\n> Tip: Use the PDF format to include images and the source for your articles.\n\n### Desktop and Mobile\nSpeaking of Cloud Sync, you can access your content from your desktop or mobile devices. The desktop and mobile software is nothing spectacular; it merely shows you your content, just as you would see on your device. You can then read, rearrange, or export your content as needed.\n\n### Jagged Line Issue\n> Tip: This could be a deal-breaker for some. I don’t feel like it is an issue, as I don’t notice it unless I’m looking for it.\n\n![](https://ericgregorich.com/uploads/2023/1f4c513904.png)\n\n> Updated March 27, 2021: The reMarkable team released version 2.6, which addresses this issue.\n\nThe ”Jagged Line Issue“ is one of the annoying things I found about Remarkable 2. If you look very closely at the writing (zoom in if it helps), you can see the lines are not smooth and jagged, depending on how you write. You can see a very (extremely detailed) video that explains the issue here.\n\n## The Writing Experience\nOkay, you want to know how this table feels when writing.\n\nIt feels remarkable, like writing on paper!\n\nOne of the things I enjoy when writing on paper is how distraction-free it is, and the ”feeling\" of writing helps me slow down and think. I get the same feeling while writing on the Remarkable. In addition to that, I can easily erase, move things around, convert to text, and search.\n\nMy writing is better when using the reMarkable. I write very small on paper, while on the reMarkable, I have more space and write larger and, therefore, more legibly.\n\nThe latency is about 21ms, which is the best in the market. There is very little noticeable lag when writing.\n\n## The Reading Experience\nI have limited experience with the reading functionality on the device. But here is what I have discovered so far.\n\n### PDF\n![](https://ericgregorich.com/uploads/2023/30046a1879.png)\n\nIn general, PDFs look great on the reMarkable 2. My only complaint is that the device is too small to read most PDFs comfortably. Articles converted to PDF work well.\n\n### EPUB\n![](https://ericgregorich.com/uploads/2023/dfa930ab6a.png)\n\nI have heard that the reMarkable doesn’t work well with EPUB, and I don’t have enough experience with them yet to know for sure. I added one EPUB to the device, \\<a href=\"https://gumroad.com/l/doing-content-right\"\\>Doing Content Right, by Steph Smith\\</a\\>. It looks great! I’ve had no problems, and it has been much easier to read than the PDF version.\n\n> Tip: You cannot read your Kindle books on this device.\n\n## The Price\n- The reMarkable itself is $399.\n- The Marker is $49. The Marker Plus is $99.\n- The Folios start at $69 and go up to $149.\n\nMy setup, the reMarkable with the Marker Plus and Book Folio, came to $597 before tax. Ouch!\n\n> Tip: Yes, you see that correctly. The reMarkable writing device does not include a Marker, which is ridiculous!\n\n## What would make the reMarkable 2 better?\n- Fix the Jagged lines issue. (reMarkable fixed the Jagged Lines issue in version 2.6)\n- Include the content, even your handwritten notes, in search results.\n- Faster sync.\n- More Text Conversion options.\n- Provide better formatting for both PDF and EPUB.\n- Better support. I have not needed to contact the reMarkable support team, but I have not heard great things regarding response times.\n- Provide more support for accessing your content without using Cloud Sync.\n\nIt is worth purchasing a reMarkable 2 if you like to write and if you like to use paper for organizing your day. Taking meeting notes, writing thoughts, drafting articles, making sketches and diagrams, disconnecting from the world, and getting lost in your thoughts is excellent.\n\nWhile I love the reMarkable 2 and use it daily as part of my workflow, it is not a perfect device. The good news is that, in theory, software updates could resolve some of the existing problems.\n\nIf you’re looking for a distraction-free digital writing device, I highly recommend it.\n\n\n",
